"sea"
"Aryes!"
"You promised we'd make it over four hills by midday!"
"Are they that rare?"
"Those are... flowers, right?"
"Yup, they're flowers. You saw them yesterday and the day before, didn't you?"
"But... it's really odd,"
"What is?"
"There were no vases beneath those flowers. Why weren't they wilted?"
"We don't have much water, so don't get dirty - didn't I tell you?"
"I was told that filth comes only from the heart,"
"It is not good to lie."
"You're right. I'm sorry."
"Ah..."
"That's a bird, is it not?"
"Yeah, it's a bird. It's not a spider, and it's not a lizard."
"And it's... flying, is it not?"
"That's right."
"Well, shall we go?"
"From this moment forth, you are no longer residents of this mansion,"
"Gather your things and leave immediately."
"Let's try to make it over six hills before sunset. At this rate there's no telling how long it'll take us to get to the sea."
"Is that a promise?"
"Sure, it's a promise."
"The night is nothing to fear. Just as the day has the sun and the night the moon, God is always watching over us."
"... Y-yeah,"
"This is what God said: A person alone fears loneliness and hunger and trembles in the cold. But with two, loneliness is healed and cold's edge softened."
"... Yeah."
"Are you still cold?"
"It is good to endure hunger. But God never wishes for us to be cold."
"-nchoo!"
"God may be angry at me for saying this,"
"But I don't think I could have done this alone. I'm so glad you're a girl, Klass."
"Is that the animal they call man?"
"I've gotten quite sleepy. Good night."
"Good night,"
"What could it be?"
"Wo-"
"Aryes, Aryes."
"What's wrong?"
"Wh-wha-?"
"Hurry - hurry, we have to go!"
"-Huh?"
"Wh-what happened?"
"There were wolves... That was a close one,"
"Wo... wolves?"
"Wolves. They were about to attack us just now, weren't they? They attack people, and they attack livestock."
"Oh, my. Are they... men?"
"Yeah. Men are wolves."
"It's all right. They've all gone off some-"
"Ngh... guh..."
"Do not worry! I will... er, no, ah - God will protect us. There is nothing to fear!"
"Still, I wonder what scared them off."
"I think we're safe now. Let's sleep. There are still hours before morning."
"You don't happen to know where a river is, do you?"
"... Ugh."
"...?"
"A-Aryes!"
"Aryes! Aryes!"
"Aryes!"
"Ugh... what... what should I do...?"
"Oh, God..."
"Whatever happened here?"
"What...?"
"What happened here, boy?"
"Ill, is she?"
"I-I-I don't know... Sh-she just fell over, and..."
"Hmm,"
"Hmph, this looks like-"
"'Tis simple exhaustion,"
"... Huh?"
"Look at how hard her legs are,"
"B-b-but-"
"She asked many times for a rest, did she not?"
"And worse, she hasn't been eating properly. 'Tis no surprise she fell."
"How did you know that?"
"Curses. Slip of the tongue."
"In truth, I'd planned not to say anything to you. But this was simply too pathetic."
"N-no, I always tried to-"
"Tried to think about her? Hmph. You knew perfectly well that her body and yours are quite different."
"Heh. I've been watching you since last night. You know well and truly that she and you are not alike,"
"I suppose that's what they mean when they say, 'The luck to be born a man.' Still"
"you had the pluck to stand your ground before the wolves. That much is praiseworthy."
"Wha... ah!"
"Hmph. Not a very discerning lad, are you?"
"If you're just noticing these, you must not have noticed this!"
"Ah... ah...!"
"'Tis fine fur, indeed, no?"
"C-could it be-"
"Could it be?"
"Last night, the one who saved us, that was..."
"Indeed,"
"It... it was you! You chased the wolves away!"
"I merely happened to be sleeping nearby. They realized I was there and turned tail of their own accord."
"Could you be a... a spirit-?"
"Hardly!"
"Hmph... well, 'tis true that some of your kind do call me such things. But I like it not."
"H-how... shall I refer to you?"
"I do not like that, either. And untangling your stumbling tongue is a nuisance."
"Come, look up. I only thought to aid you in your difficult travels. I did not reveal myself to you to endure your worship."
"Heh. You're still at the age where such an expression suits you."
"My name is Holo,"
"M-my name's Klass... ma'am."
"No need for 'ma'am' here."
"R-right."
"And this one's name is Aryes?"
"Y-yes, that's right, but-"
"How do I know?"
"Did you not call her name out so charmingly and so many times? 'Aryes, Aryes!'?"
"I don't know that shaking a weakened comrade so is a kindness, though."
"Having lost consciousness, I'm sure she's calmed herself a bit. Just wipe her mouth clean and keep her warm now."
"I'll watch her for you,"
"Honestly, if this were wintertime, you'd be dead on the roadside somewhere,"
"You've no blankets! What were you intending to do in case of rain?"
"Huh? Er..."
"Take shelter somewhere... I suppose..."
"'Twas on a lark I decided to follow the strange pair wandering away across these plains without so much as a spring or a river, but to think you'd have been so unprepared!"
"And while we're speaking of strange things, you're odd companions indeed. Why are two children traveling alone?"
"Foolish boy. I'm at least two centuries your elder."
"I-I'm sorry."
"I daresay the mansion you were driven from was of a noble house called Antheo."
"Y-yes... you know them?"
"I heard a bit about them in a town I was in not long ago - that there was an eccentric nobleman out in the countryside. But I see - so he's dead, is he?"
"Indeed, you set out on a journey and were a helpless chick before long."
"..."
"Be not angry, boy. Were you yourself not surprised at the size of the world?"
"Nay, the reason I know that is because I felt the same way when I set out on my own travels."
"... Is that so?"
"Aye. The world is vast indeed. And-"
"Aryes-"
"Ah... wha- why-?"
"You collapsed just a moment ago! Don't you remember?"
"As a servant of God, I am deeply ashamed. However, I am now well."
"Oh, my..."
"Oh... you're from far across the sea, aren't you?"
"Aye. I'm called Holo, and I've traveled here from far in the north."
"I am Aryes Belange,"
"So, how can we assist you?"
"N-no! Ho-Holo... she saved you, Aryes."
"Lady Holo"
"My sincere apologies - and again, my thanks,"
"And if that is true, then I would very much like to repay the kindness you showed in saving me."
"Kindness, eh?"
"Yes. Unfortunately we are but travelers and are limited in what we can offer."
"Hmph. I need no material goods. Instead, let me see..."
"Would you let me travel with you for a while?"
"Huh?!"
"If it would please you to do so."
"I'm thankful."
"Well, my things are over yonder. Would you help me gather them?"
"Ah, yes."
"Aryes, you rest."
"But-"
"Just rest,"
"Over this way,"
"Heh. You needn't have been so demanding,"
"Uh... well..."
"You could've merely said physical work is for men, nay?"
"Ah, such troubles!"
"Still, I expect eight or nine of ten males would act the same way. 'Tis nothing you need worry over,"
"Oh, come now, I'm your ally."
"Heh, 'tis true I'm making sport of you. However-"
"Shall the three of us sleep together tonight? With you in the middle, of course."
"What, can you not wait until evening?"
"I'll make a proper male of you yet."
"Let us all sleep together,"
"Shall I try to guess why you're making such a face?"
"You're the last."
"'Twas a gift. No need for restraint."
"Oh, that? I've already persuaded her. Look,"
"Yyou're throwing food-!"
"It is the nature of the world that the wheat of the harvest will eventually return to the earth. Is there some reason I cannot throw bread, which is merely wheat ground into flour and baked?"
"Huh...?"
"That's how it's done, lad,"
"So, your destination was the sea, was it?"
"M-more or less,"
"A meandering journey for two, eh?"
"That's not really what it is, but..."
"If you're not truly wandering, then you've got to decide on a proper destination,"
"Still, your eating is as slow as your waking is late."
"Huh?"
"What is it that humans say? Eating like you need a knife and spoon, eh?"
"Right, then, let us gather our things and set off. The sea is yet far, but the next town is quite close."
"What do you mean, you can't carry it alone? How did you come this far, then?"
"You really want to know?"
"Shall I help you?"
"But..."
"Take this, then."
"Well, let's go."
"I forgot to give my thanks for protecting me from the wolves, so thank you very much!"
"Um, y-you're welcome."
"Please, don't worry about it,"
"A-anyway, let's stop and eat."
"Aryes?!"
"What's wrong?"
"Wh-what's that...?"
"A rabbit? What about it?"
"Its... Its ears..."
"All rabbits have ears like that. Those long ears are how they hear things far away."
"Are you quite certain that... someone didn't do something terrible to it?"
"Yes,"
"Still, it sure looks tasty."
"Huh? Uh, er, no, I-I meant the grass the rabbit is eating. It sure looks like it's tasty! That's all I meant!"
"Ah, I see. I'm so sorry, I thought-"
"No, it's fine - I'm sorry I scared you."
"There undoubtedly is-"
"Hmm?"
"Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, there undoubtedly is much I don't know about in the world,"
"Well, lets see more of it!"
"Oh?"
"We'll go far away. To the ocean, to all over."
"Yes, lets. Though I suppose I'll need to walk a bit faster,"
"So long as you don't collapse,"
"Let's be off,"
"... Guh..."
"Heh-heh. I suppose you're a bit young yet."
"Looks like this one's not just taller than you, she's more grown-up, too."
"Wine is the blood of God. If you can't drink this, it's proof that God's teachings aren't entering your body,"
"Wine is meant to be enjoyed. There are other liquors to drink to prove your pluck."
"Though I do pity you being unable to enjoy this pleasure."
"Still, when one constantly calls upon God after having received His blessing, failures will also increase,"
"It pains me to hear it,"
"The most common failure is being unable to wait as the juice drips from the cloth one has bound the grapes in..."
"And so you wring it out by hand, yes? And then for some reason, it tastes awful."
"'If grape wine is the blood of God, and the blood of God is the blessing taken from his body, then you are fools who seek blessings though it injures God,' I was told."
"I felt deeply sorry. I knew I would never do such a thing again."
"And so you leashed your craving, eh?"
"I keep God's teachings and receive only those blessings I have earned."
"Catching one drop at a time, then licking it from your finger would surely be..."
"Still, 'twould be a poor life not to know this particular pleasure,"
"... Mph..."
"Maybe I shouldn't have,"
"Whew..."
"What, so you never noticed me?"
"Th-thought you were an owl spirit!"
"Hmph, and yet I am a wolf."
"Wh-what?"
"I've something I wish to ask you,"
"Something to ask me...?"
"'Tis about Antheo, under whom you worked for a time."
"The lord?"
"Aye. Are you quite certain that he died?"
"'Quite certain,' you say... I just... I don't know."
"Hmph... but from what I heard, he had a habit of going on long journeys."
"Ah, well, that is - after a while, he would come back with strange objects or people."
"So what you're saying is that even at best you don't know where he traveled. Dim hope, indeed,"
"Did you know him?"
"Me? No, nothing of the sort."
"From what I heard, Antheo was seeking an immortality elixir."
"Im... mort...?"
"Immortality. It means living forever without getting old."
"Wha-?"
"Heh. You've only just been born, so of course you can't imagine it."
"Compared to many other creatures, humans live quite a bit longer, but they still grow old and decrepit in a twinkling. Even I cannot claim not to understand why one would want to avoid such a fate."
"Oh - but I'm sure you'll always stay young and pretty the way you are now, Miss Holo!"
"Something about being reassured by a child so young rubs me the wrong way. But of course, my beauty is eternal."
"But your words are half right,"
"Huh?"
"'Twas not I that would use the immortality elixir,"
"Then who?"
"One more thing,"
"So I hear Aryes lived in the same building since birth? Is that true?"
"I-I think so. At least, the adult servants all said so."
"Hmmm."
"What's the matter?"
"Ah, 'tis well. But if Antheo is truly dead, that means I've no longer a destination. I meant it as a bit of a joke, but I may be traveling with you for quite some time."
"..."
"I may well be a nuisance, but to have it show so plainly on your face hurts a bit."
"N-no, I didn't mean-"
"Ah, so I can stay with you forever?"
"At that rate, you'll have no cause to complain if your dear Aryes slaps you clean across your face."
"Heh-heh. Ah, well, 'tis the right of all children to be honest. Should you be fool enough to bring her flowers, I'll be kind enough to let you."
"Still, I envy you."
"...?"
"What would you do if wolves were to appear right now and attack?"
"Er, I'd try not to get in your way..."
"'Tis a logical answer indeed, but there's nothing so hated as a selfish male."
"I-I see..."
"You do not see. You should've said something more like 'I would sacrifice myself to protect you.' Come now,"
"I... I would sacrifice..."
"Hmph."
"... S-sacrifice..."
"Mm?"
"... Myself..."
"Sacrifice myself to protect,"
"Oh, right, 'Sacrifice myself to protect you.'"
"Heh. Aye, I suppose that'll do,"
"Still, if that's so difficult you'll have a hard time climbing that next step."
"Er, next step?"
"Aye."
"Heh."
"Goodness, if I were to bite you like this, it's as though you would just die on the spot."
"..."
"Ho, I can't very well devour you thus,"
"When you look at me like that, it makes me want to continue, it does."
"Don't be angry. It's not as though I'm offering not to do it only if you'll protect me from that."
"Huh?"
"Oh-"
"A-Arye-!"
"I have heard that love burns brighter when its road has many obstacles,"
"N-no, that's not-!"
"Well, then there's no need for concern, is there?"
"This won't do. When I see such a lovely cub, I can't help but tease it,"
"You cannot simply gaze greedily at a thing forever,"
"But you've learned something now, yes?"
"Huh?"
"Ah, 'tis well,"
"But know this: It's not only wolves that will bare their fangs at you and her. Far from it, as she is a young maiden."
"Wha-?"
"You've about as much charm as you have lesser traits. Now all you need is courage."
"Still,"
"... Oh."
"Hurry. Will you not eat? You're last to finish again."
"Eating with haste is an art unto itself,"
"'Tis a lovely view,"
"Pretty great scenery, eh?"
"Er, is... is that the sea?"
"No, that's a swamp,"
"Swamp?"
"It's sort of like a pond. But it's shallower and muddier."
"So-"
"is the sea anything like this?"
"The sea is much, much bigger!"
"And just how big is it?"
"Wha-?"
"It's so big that no matter which way you look - left, right, straight ahead - all you can see is the sea."
"I hope we can see it soon."
"So, we'll pass between the forest and the marsh. The town's not far beyond, but..."
"Is the road rough?"
"No. When I came this way from the town, it was not so difficult. 'Tis much faster to cut through the forest - and more dangerous. What worries me is not the road, but what lies beyond it."
"Beyond it?"
"Aye. To be frank, I mean the state of your coin purse."
"Oh ho, so this is your fortune, is it?"
"Is this money?"
"Sure is."
"I was taught that money is the root of all evil. But it's nothing like what I thought."
"I'm not certain this will buy a piece of bread,"
"Huh?"
"I don't well understand the thing called money. I can quickly know the quality of a pelt, though, so 'tis hardly a burden, but..."
"I think this bought a loaf of bread. With this silver one, you can buy a lot. What think you? I know not the details, but you can tell the difference between this and yours, can you not?"
"Just being in a town costs money, to say nothing of the bread you'll need to buy to continue your travel. What do you imagine you'll do?"
"Bread is the fruit of labor. If we work, we'll be fine,"
"Th-that's right. If we work, we'll be all right."
"Mm,"
"What if a hard day's work doesn't buy you a day's worth of food? What then?"
"W-we'll just work harder!"
"You'll work harder, will you? Aye, and then the question becomes whether there's work for you at all."
"There are scores of adults unable to find work in the town - do you think two children like you will go and have an easy time of it?"
"Wha-?"
"You've neither strength nor skill, and you know no one in the town. I hear things are different in the human world if you can read and write, but..."
"You can read, right, Aryes?"
"So what will Klass do as Aryes is toiling away?"
"Oh, I wouldn't mind if Klass waited for me."
"Th-that's right. I'll wait."
"Still, I can't imagine there are so many jobs that involve reading and writing."
"However, I've been thinking,"
"What would you say to turning back here?"
"From here we could fetch some water from the marsh, and if you took my food, you could make it back. There's no gain in forcing yourselves onward. And though you say you were driven from the mansion, you're yet children. If you appeal to their emotions, I'm sure all would be well."
"I can tell what you're thinking, boy,"
"If you continue with any goal or plan or destination, what will happen when your food runs out? When you have no money and no work? 69/187 Will you beg? Will you sit on the roadside dressed in rags, covered in mud and filth?"
"You're rather stubborn,"
"I-I would also like to go and see the ocean. And see more of the world."
"And?"
"But I know little of the world. I cannot refute a single thing you've said, Miss Holo. And I've learned that the world is filled with all manner of suffering."
"Aye,"
"Aryes?"
"Is- is that..."
"I've been told this is a very precious thing, so perhaps it could buy us some bread."
"Oh. So you were willing to part with that, then?"
"Huh -?"
"I took notice of it right away when we were sleeping... What, did you not realize it was there, boy?"
"You must've been distracted by the softness, eh?"
"N-no, I wasn't!"
"Well, in any case, if you're willing to part with that, you'll be secure for a while."
"So-"
"However, are you truly prepared to do that? Precious stones have special meaning, no matter the era or nation. If it's a memento from someone, you may wish to rethink your decision."
"No, I don't know who I received this from - only that the priest said that if someday I should find myself in trouble, it would help me. I think now that time has come."
"You say you don't know who you got it from? It had something written in the setting. What was it?"
"It's my name."
"Just your name?"
"No, my name and a short message. It says... 'I give this to Aryes, my daughter.'"
"What?"
"To my daughter,"
"Aye. That is a valuable gem, indeed. Not something that just anyone could give to a child. Surely you understand all too well what that means."
"Ah-"
"So who do you think gave such a thing to you?"
"Huh? Er-"
"God, I suppose."
"I'm sorry, I don't see-"
"Your god would hardly dirty his hands digging up gems. The one who gave that to you-"
"-Was the lord of the mansion!"
"Aryes, you're the lord's-"
"Wha...? I... but... the lord of the mansion is... God?"
"No! Aryes, you're the lords daughter, and the lord is a human!"
"But-"
"How does it go? 'We are all of us God's children' or some such."
"Aye."
"Even I understand human manners. That is not something you should say just now."
"As someone who's lived her share of years, I don't think that stone is something you should lose,"
"Miss Holo, I really think we-"
"It never rains but pours, eh?"
"M-Miss Holo...?"
"Listen, you, did Antheo's younger brother, the one who drove you away, strike you as a kind man?"
"No."
"So what do you think a man who'd come to take his elder brother's place would do if he found out there was already a directly related successor?"
"You two have good fortune indeed to have escaped before they realized,"
"You've about as much charm as you have lesser points. What else does one need, I wonder?"
"Aryes, stand up,"
"They're still some distance away, but - curses - they're not coming in peace. 'Tis bad enough we're being followed, but it'll be trouble indeed if we're flanked."
"So they're cutting through the forest, eh? Come, you-"
"Aryes-"
"It'll be all right. I'm here,"
"... All right,"
"Let's go."
"Aryes!"
"I'm all right."
"Is your foot sprained?"
"What is the matter?"
"Aryes - she stumbled."
"Did she sprain anything?"
"Then we must keep running, or we're in trouble. We've got a bit yet to cover."
"Why, if the worst should happen, you've got that staff in place of a spear, have you not?"
"In any case, so long as we reach the town ahead of our pursuers, we'll be all right for a while. Come, let us go,"
"God is always watching over us,"
"Let's go."
"-!"
"... A bird?"
"Aryes, are you all right? It's just a bird."
"A... a bird...?"
"That's right,"
"Never mind that. We have to catch up with Miss Holo!"
"Miss Holo-"
"Seems our tail isn't coming."
"Wha-?"
"Is this some kind of scheme? Still..."
"M-maybe they're lost...?"
"Possibly. I'll go have a look,"
"You two should have a rest. 'Twould be dangerous for you to run longer. There's naught to fear; I'll be back presently,"
"Wha- ah- Aryes!"
"Water."
"Water? W-wait just a moment-"
"Do you feel bad?"
"Oh, you're sleepy?"
"You should sleep a bit,"
"...?"
"Must be my imagination..."
"You look as though you're about to tell me you've seen a forest spirit."
"..."
"I brought water."
"Mm, I see,"
"... May I not have some?"
"Huh?"
"May I not have some water?"
"Oh, er, yes."
"You want to give it a try too?"
"N-never mind about that. What about the people coming after us?"
"They weren't there,"
"Wha-?"
"They weren't there."
"But that means we're-"
"-Safe? Aye, it might be a bit early to say that. But at least it seems we won't be caught right away."
"Of course, there are probably also men walking outside the forest, so we're not completely safe yet. Our first job is to cross the forest and make it to the town."
"Let us take a bit of a rest. We pushed ourselves rather hard to make it this far."
"Yes... I guess we did,"
"You needn't be on your guard so."
"Come"
"If you'll sleep a bit, your strength will return. We've some distance yet to cover. You'd best sleep."
"Depending on what may come, you may have to carry Aryes over your shoulder if she becomes exhausted."
"Heh-heh-heh... you're such a faithful male, you are."
"Seems I didn't actually have to do anything after all."
"Huh?"
"Nothing. 'Twas merely talking to myself. Anyway-"
"I simply hate losing, you see."
"I wonder if you'll be able to raise your head now, eh?"
"I suspected as much,"
"Do not worry. I'll make sure to wake you before she rises."
"'Tis nothing - a bit of indebtedness will only make you treat her more kindly."
"Wha...?"
"Now then, next..."
"Ah, it seems the sleepyhead has finally come awake."
"..."
"Miss Holo said I mustn't let go,"
"It is a test from God, she said,"
"Rain, eh? Well, so long as it's no worse than this, we'll get no wetter for our walking in the forest."
"Aryes, is there anything else you'd like to see besides the sea?"
"What else...?"
"I've heard there are mountains that shoot fire and places where rivers run out of the sky."
"Hmm... have you ever seen any wheat fields?"
"Wheat fields?"
"Yeah. You know wheat, right?"
"They're where wheat comes from, whole fields like a golden carpet."
"Wheat fields..."
"They look really fluffy when you see them from far away, like you just want to jump into them - but if you do, they're not fluffy at all. And if you knock over too much wheat, the adults will beat you with sticks,"
"Did you reflect on your misdeeds?"
"You bet I did,"
"In that case, God will forgive you,"
"O-or a ship!"
"I know about ships."
"Oh, er, really?"
"Even though you didn't know about the sea?"
"When the earth is covered in a great flood, that's a giant vehicle that will take all the righteous people to the kingdom in the sky."
"The ships I know about don't fly in the sky, I don't think."
"...?"
"They float on rivers and lakes and things, on water, anyways. People ride on them, and they carry horses and such, too."
"On the... water?"
"That's right."
"And they don't sink?"
"They don't. Even if you put a bunch of people and a whole lot of heavy bags of wheat on them, they still don't sink."
"It's a sin to lie, you know."
"I'm not lying! I saw it with my own eyes."
"It could have been the work of a demon."
"So what would you do if you saw a ship floating on the water?"
"If it were floating on the water...?"
"Yes, floating on the water."
"I would apologize."
"It's a promise, then."
"It pains me to ruin such a hard-earned mood,"
"I kept mum about it because if I'd said anything, 'twould have made you nervous, and nerves invite injury. But it seems I must tell you."
"Our pursuers are coming."
"Wha-?"
"B-but you said they weren't coming-"
"Aye,"
"Our human pursuers are not coming."
"I thought it strange. This is a grand, large forest. It should have a master. For such a master not to appear... Also, the group that was following us - I can't believe they'd suddenly turn tail. So-"
"So they've either been tricked by dwellers of the forest, or..."
"Dwellers of the forest...?"
"I'm a wisewolf after all. Between my words and wisdom, I often get my own way, but that lot seems to have gotten rather crafty as well. I'd like to get out of this forest straightaway... and even I can't do anything about the weather,"
"Do you mean the... the deer?"
"You saw it, did you?"
"Yes. When I was fetching water and also just a moment ago. It was staring right at me, not moving at all."
"They're a cunning lot. I've no idea what they might do. There's not much use in telling you to be on your guard, but I suppose it's better than being suddenly ambushed in ignorance, eh?"
"It'll be all right. A wolf's stronger than a deer."
"Human cubs surely do grow quickly."
"Ah, well, 'twill work out somehow. The rain's a calamity for more than us."
"Well, shall we be off?"
"Keep at it,"
"Miss Holo!"
"..."
"I just..."
"I am sorry."
"Huh?"
"I am stopping,"
"I am sorry."
"Wh-what for?"
"I may not be able to save you."
"Wha-?"
"..."
"... Ah..."
"-."
"-. -."
"A good journey-"
"-is one in which you're blessed with a good companion."
"-!"
"-, -."
"-... -."
"Seems this lot doesn't like me overmuch."
"My coming along has complicated things."
"Wrooooooooaaaa!"
"They say parting always comes suddenly. 'Twas a lovely journey. The two of you should hurry off and run-"
"Aaaaauuuah!"
"Ar... yes..."
"Wrrooooaaaa!"
"-...! -...!"
"Aryes!"
"Klass..."
"Aryes!"
"..."
"It'll be all right,"
"Aryes, can you stand?"
"Right, then stay behind me."
"When I stand up, run."
"Wha-? B-but-"
"It'll be all right. I know the story of the hero who defeated the giant."
"I'll aim for the eyes. Those big eyes. If he can't see, he can't follow us. It'll be all right. That thing's eyes are so huge, I can't miss."
"Right, here we go."
"Let's see the sea together,"
"Damn you-!"
"-!"
"Aaaaaauuoh!"
"Aryes!"
"Aryes, we've got to run!"
"B-but, his eye..."
"We've got to hurry! If we're followed, there'll be nothing we can do!"
"Ha-ha-ha, we did it! Come, Aryes! Let's go!"
"Ah, er, b-but-"
"Can't you walk? Come-"
"O-oof."
"P-please, just..."
"Sorry. You... go on ahead."
"-! -!"
"Run,"
"Wha-?"
"Ar-Aryes..."
"G-good morning,"
"How... how do you feel?"
"Ha-ha-ha-ha, I'm a mess,"
"Wha...? No, er, d-don't... don't cry!"
"I'm all right - see?"
"Hmph,"
"Wha-?"
"Oww..."
"Heh. Seems you're in the middle of something, eh?"
"Ah- wha-?"
"What's that? Only one girl embracing you upon awakening isn't enough?"
"Miss Holo!"
"You needn't shout so; I can hear you well enough."
"B-but, I - I thought you were-"
"Dead, you say?"
"Heh-heh. You heard the lad,"
"A human child... with such courage. How many centuries... has it been... since I've... had... such fun...?"
"It... it can't be..."
"You fool. Just who did you think you were attacking?"
"I suppose the deer got a bit over enthused and played their part up rather more than I'd planned. Honestly, even I couldn't put them off it."
"If you start doubting such things in matters like these, you truly are a fool."
"Heh-heh. Still, you were quite gallant. Was he not?"
"I'm sorry I didn't... say anything... but..."
"It's okay, really. I'm just glad we're safe..."
"... All right."
"Oh-"
"Hmm?"
"What about our pursuers?"
"Pursuers?"
"W-wait, don't tell me that was a lie, too-"
"Heh-heh-heh,"
"Now then, we can't very well stay in this den forever - we must go out. There lies holy forest ground the likes of which few humans will ever see."
"Holy... forest ground?"
"Aye. It's quite a sight, is it not?"
"The sun's been long up. Let us go and bask - your warrior tale will make a fine appetizer when considering what to do next. After all,"
"the three of us have a journey ahead of us."
"So, this holy ground - was it really so great?"
"I suppose..."
"Still..."
"I'd rather visit the sea."
"Well, shall we go?"
"Hmm?"
"He who chases two rabbits catches neither."
"Shall I guess what you are thinking?"
"So you were eating all along...? How many did you have?"
"Ten and... seven. No, nine."
"And what's left?"
"... E-eight..."
"Eight?"
"Eighty... one."
"You're going to ask me if I'm going to eat them all."
"I haven't said anything yet."
"So what was to follow that sigh, eh?"
"Can you eat them all?"
"You don't have to be so stubborn,"
"I'm not being stubborn."
"Really?"
"... The truth is... I'm a bit full of them..."
"I'll bet. Even if they're your favorite food, that's a lot of apples."
"Still-"
"Hmm?"
"Still, I swear I'll eat them all."
"You needn't get so worked up about it,"
"Even if you tire of eating them raw, there are many ways to eat an apple."
"If you bring yourself to ruin, apples will be the cause, I tell you."
"So, tell me of these 'other ways' to eat them."
"Hmm, well, you could bake them."
"You'd best prepare for the consequences if you're making sport of me."
"Can't your ears always tell lies from truth?"
"Baking apples... I've never heard of the like."
"Ha-ha, I suppose not. It's not as though one roasts them on a spit over an open flame. It's more like bread baked in an oven."
"Hmph."
"So you've never had apple pie, then?"
"Hmm. I suppose it would be quickest to just show it to you. When you bake apples, they turn soft - it's a bad example, but they're almost as soft baked as they are when rotten."
"Mmph."
"But just as something on the verge of spoiling can be tasty, baked apples are amazing. You know how a raw apple is good for a parched throat? Baked apples are so sweet you actually get thirsty."
"I... see,"
"Anyway, they're good apples to begin with, so they'll be good no matter how you prepare them. Though you'll tire of sweetness, too, won't you?"
"Salted meat or salted fish - which do you prefer?"
"Meat!"
"So, for dinner-"
"What, you intend to go right now?"
"Aren't we?"
"... So I'll ask you again, do you think you can eat all those apples?"
"After hearing you, I've made up my mind to do it. You needn't worry."
"I suppose I have business, so why not? Let's go."
"Right!"
"You should smile like that more; 'tis nice."
"You're really rather unpalatable, you know."
"Am I to claim deliciousness, then?"
"Far from it,"
"You look every bit the nun."
"Mm?"
"I was saying I don't want to think about how much your food bill is running."
"Humph. Is there some inconvenience with my looking like a nun?"
"Far from it; it makes travel all the more convenient."
"Hmm. To be able to so easily change so much by simply choosing clothes - the human world surely is a strange one."
"I'm sure wolves would find something convenient in wearing sheepskins, if they could manage it."
"Aye, and if I wore a rabbit skin, you'd happily walk right into any trap."
"So for you, I'll bait my trap with apples."
"Anyway, it's not without inconveniences, especially in your case."
"There are all sorts of problems with a nun drinking wine in the middle of the day. Most taverns will overlook it, but you could stand to consider such things a bit more."
"Mm. 'Tis like drinking on a rickety bridge that could fall at any moment."
"Also, different towns have different circumstances. Especially as we head north, there may be places where a nun would be a very bad disguise, indeed."
"What shall I do then?"
"It would be safest to have a change of clothes that would make you look like a town girl."
"In that case, can we not buy them before dinner? Anything that lessens our safety will make the food taste worse."
"I'm glad you understand. There's no time to waste convincing you."
"What, did you think I would insist on food and wine first? I'm not so blinded by gluttony as that."
"Aren't you?"
"Humph. You're trying to take care of me. I've got to take advantage of that, haven't I?"
"That's quite a grand excuse to buy new clothes. Did you think I wouldn't notice?"
"Heh. Ah, well, if you're buying me some new things, I'm happy to impose on you. The cold winter awaits, after all."
"You could impose a bit less."
"'Tis cold. My hand will freeze."
"Yes, it certainly is cold."
"Aye."
"Yeah."
"What is the matter?"
"I've... no money."
"However, for the sake of my honor, I must explain that when I say, 'I have no money,' I don't mean what you think I mean."
"Huh?"
"I mean I've got no small change."
"Yup, none,"
"They say too big is better than too small. 'Tis not as though you've no money at all."
"They also say not to kill a fly with a sledgehammer. Didn't you say the same thing to me when buying bread?"
"Mph. So we'll need change, then."
"We'll have to exchange it. If we gave gold coins to the tailor, there's no telling what kind of a terrible face he'd make."
"Mm... still-"
"Are gold coins really so very valuable?"
"Huh? They certainly are. The lumione coins in my purse now are trading for around thirty-five pieces of trenni silver. If you don't stay at an inn and don't drink any wine, you can live for a week on a single trenni. So think about thirty-five times that."
"... That's quite something, indeed. So why would a tailor be bothered to get one in payment?"
"Unlike apples, a gold coin might buy only one or two pieces of clothing. I was told these clothes cost two gold pieces."
"If all clothing cost that much, the greater part of the townsfolk would be walking around totally naked."
"Hmm... this was so costly, was it?"
"That's right. So from now on, let's keep our purchases to the poorer stuff."
"I'm Holo, the Wisewolf of Yoitsu. 'Twill wound my reputation to wear poor clothes."
"Still, money changing..."
"If you don't like it, you better get to know us better,"
"Money changing, eh? That means... oh ho."
"Well, then, you'd better make the arrangements. I want to be drinking wine sooner rather than later."
"For one lumione, today's rate is thirty-four trenni."
"And the fee?"
"Ten silver lute or thirty copper trie."
"I'll pay in lute."
"Very good, then. Right here, then... Oh, please do take care. Anything you drop on the street becomes the property of he who picks it up,"
"Weiz."
"What?"
"I'm your customer."
"Just leave the gold there. I'm busy right now."
"And what is it you're busy with?"
"Can't you tell? I'm right in the middle of making sure this lovely maiden doesn't drop her silver."
"But, sir-"
"There seems to be too much silver for my hands to hold."
"My dear Miss Holo, that is why you have my hands as well."
"I could not possibly impose such a weight upon you."
"If silver overflows from your hand, then I will gladly lend you mine. It would not trouble me in the slightest - because, my dear, I am sure that you, Miss Holo, will accept my feelings in turn, feelings so passionate I cannot hold them in both arms."
"Silver coins for the coin purse, gold for the box, and plain copper in hand - or have you forgotten that proverb, Weiz?"
"Bah. Keeping a lovely girl like this all to yourself is an insult to God. Haven't you ever heard 'Share thine bread with others'?"
"You want me to share?"
"There's no lending at the cambist's table. Only exchange or no exchange,"
"She comes with the debt she owes me. Do you mind?"
"Hmph,"
"I cannot possibly put a price upon you."
"I'm afraid the scales within my heart are still swinging. But I'm sure they will not simply tilt under the weight of gold..."
"Oh, but of course."
"To put your hands upon a swinging scale... sir, you truly are a scoundrel,"
"Come, let's be off."
"Oh, hey, Lawrence-"
"Hmm?"
"So if you came all the way out to change money, are you doing some kind of shopping?"
"Yes, were heading north, so I'm getting clothes and such."
"S-so, you're going soon, then?"
"Yes, probably..."
"Prices rise with the sun after all. I'd like to buy what I need before the day's out."
"Ugh..."
"Well, then,"
"Can money be exchanged after the sun sets?"
"The market's decided that cambists who use scales after the sun sets are all swindlers. And, of course, I'm no swindler."
"You heard him,"
"Once we've bought our clothes, we'll be heading to the tavern. When you're done with work, you should come by if you're free."
"Of course, brother! The usual tavern?"
"I'd be scared to get drunk in a place I didn't know."
"Right, got it. I'll be there - I'll surely be there!"
"What, again?"
"Heh. I knew that would be amusing,"
"If you toy with people too much, you'll regret it later."
"Regret?"
"You'll be followed around."
"I'm already being followed around by you."
"Unlike you, he knows I'm playing with him. 'Tis amusing enough toying with you, but sometimes one longs for a cleverer male to play with."
"We both know 'tis mere play; do not be so serious. You're making me bashful now."
"'Tis well, though. Weiz has a cleverer tongue than you, but I've lived long enough to know that nothing is so untrustworthy as the words we say. Living in the world of trade as you do, surely you're not entirely unaware of that yourself."
"It's true. I'll tell any lie if it'll bring me a profit."
"They won't work on me, though."
"So, shall we go buy some clothes?"
"Aye."
"Huh..."
"That one's forty lute. It's quite sturdy for the price, I must say."
"Sir, as we are going north, could you possibly choose some warmer items for the two of us? And not too expensive, please."
"And your budget?"
"Two trenni."
"Very well, sir."
"For tops and bottoms plus two blankets, how does this sound?"
"Yes... well, as you can see, I'm a traveling merchant, and I've come here on business with a trading company I know well - the Milone Company."
"And it seems I'll be coming here several times a year."
"Very good, sir. I quite understand. Shall I add this cloak, then? It's been treated with smoke, of course. I guarantee it'll be vermin-free for two years."
"I thought we'd come to buy clothes for me,"
"That's right... and?"
"Are you... saying I should wear this?"
"If you want to fight the cold with just that robe, I don't mind, but..."
"If you're angry about my using your money, just say as much. I'm Holo the Wisewolf. I've brains and beauty, but my nose is good, too. 'Twould wrinkle my nose to wear such a thing."
"Perhaps a bit of hardship will fix your wrinkled spirits."
"Don't be angry. I'll explain the secret here."
"Sir, a word, please."
"Hnnnggh... There. Yes?"
"Have you no fine ladies' clothing?"
"Ladies' clothing, you say?"
"Something that could be worn in a northern town and is about her size,"
"Very well. One moment, please."
"What about something like this? A certain merchant house sold it to me upon the change of the season,"
"Perhaps the lady does not like it."
"I've no time for these silly colors."
"I want something simpler. Something easy to put on."
"In that case..."
"Excuse me, sir, but what is that?"
"Yes?"
"Indeed. Now that my eye's upon it, you're quite right."
"This was a very fine piece once worn by a certain nobleman."
"The leathers beautifully tanned, you see, here, and the edges are carefully sewn without a single rip. Notice also this walnut button. You fix it about your shoulders like this - like so - there. If she wears it along with one of the special kerchiefs the nobleman had made for his house staff, she'll be every bit the charming town lass."
"Rabbit, eh?"
"Does it make you want to eat rabbit?"
"This will do."
"You heard the lady. How much, my good man?"
"Thank you for your business. For the two of them, hmm, perhaps ten trenni? No - make it nine."
"Understood. Then as an exception for this lovely young lady, eight pieces."
"In that case, out of consideration for my lovely self putting these on and modeling them, how about seven?"
"Very well. I shall let them go for seven."
"Thank you!"
"Were the clothes very expensive?"
"Not really. They're very good for seven silver pieces."
"Do you think you could've haggled him down further?"
"If it had been clothes for you to wear, you would've paid a tenth of that, would you not?"
"Yes,"
"But I was sure it was going to be more than that, so don't trouble yourself over it."
"If you'll go easy on the wine at the tavern later, you can handily make up seven silver pieces' worth."
"I hardly drink that much."
"Still, you drive a hard, hard bargain."
"Oh?"
"Not even the canniest merchant can compare, can they?"
"Hmph. Males are all of them idiots,"
"What will you do with your load there? Are you carrying it straight to the tavern?"
"This? No, I'm not."
"If you're returning to the inn, isn't it that way?"
"I'm not leaving it at the inn, either."
"Hrm?"
"I'm going to sell it to a different clothier. We'll be able to buy up cold-weather gear once we're a bit farther north."
"You're... selling them?"
"Yes. There's no point in carrying them around when we're not going to use them."
"Mm... I suppose that is true... but will you be able to sell them dear?"
"I wonder. I doubt it will be too bad, but we'll probably take a small loss."
"You're going to sell them... even... at a loss?"
"Don't get it, eh?"
"Wait. I'm thinking."
"Mmm..."
"Shall I tell you the trick?"
"It's no great thing - and in the end, it's you who's the impressive one."
"Huh...?"
"This bundle is two silver pieces' worth of clothing. So let's say I take it to a different clothier and sell it for half that. That's a loss of one silver piece."
"Aye."
"But let's turn our thinking to something else. Anyone can tell the robe you're wearing is a high-quality item. We can even say that someone wearing such a robe would never go to that kind of shop. So when they see you with me, they're going to want to establish a good relationship with me. So what does that shop do?"
"Sell cheaply."
"Right. So what does that imply?"
"When I bought the bundle from that shop, he lowered the price a bit. When I bought the fine clothes for you, he lowered it quite a bit. By showing me generosity, he hopes I'll come shop there again later. After all, I bought up a bundle of rags for two silver pieces. But there's a big gap in price between the two items. So what does that lead to?"
"So,"
"looking at the difference between the loss you take when you sell the bundle and the discount the shopkeeper gave you because you bought it, even if you take a loss on the bundle, you still come out ahead in total - is that it?"
"Well done!"
"Hmph. 'Tis a roundabout way of doing things. I'll say that."
"It's called business sense. But your techniques are far stronger, there's no doubt."
"But of course. Your flimsy ideas are no match for my scheming."
"Gee, thanks."
"Oh ho. You think you can best me?"
"Well, if you've such confidence, why not try your luck in the tavern later?"
"Make sure you buy me for a high price, aye?"
"Oh, I'll buy you, all right - but I'm paying in apples."
"You're quite harsh yourself sometimes."
"Sweeter when cooked, though."
"Too sweet for me to eat."
"And what about you?"
"Take a bite and see, if you dare."
"Still, I never knew sheep could find rock salt,"
"It's because they love the saltiness for some reason. If you rub salt onto a rock, they'll lick it for ages."
"Oh, so that's true? I once heard about a far-off town where they use sheep like that as a form of torture - very strange. I didn't believe it, honestly."
"They use... sheep?"
"I've forgotten what the name of the town was, but what they'd do was they'd have sheep lick your feet as a kind of torture."
"Wha-? Sheep would-"
"That's right. They have the sheep lick your feet, and apparently they put salt on them. Criminals laugh at first, which is bad enough. But eventually the licking starts to become agony..."
"I suppose I've had trouble with the sheep trying to lick my fingers after I've eaten jerky. They're well behaved, but they don't have any restraint, which is a bit scary."
"I imagine your faithful knight is more reasonable on that count."
"knight"
"You mean Enek? Well... Enek is Enek, and sometimes he tries a little too hard or is rather... unaccommodating..."
"Which means that to keep both dog and sheep in line, you must be quite skilled indeed."
"By the way, Miss Norah, will you be pursuing your dream now? Her dream. She started at the word, and for the first time realized that she was becoming drowsy. 151/187 Perhaps this entire infuriating conversation had been a dream, she thought, but hurriedly dismissed the notion. She now felt genuinely unwell. There was nothing left to do except try and somehow get to the inn undetected. This was enemy territory. The methods she would otherwise use were likely to backfire here. If she were to mar the hard-won celebration by saying she felt sick, that would be more than enough to ruin the evening. And the only one to blame for that was her. But she did have her own territory - their small room in the inn. If she admitted she felt sick there, that would be tantamount to a successful hunt. She thought of it like being hidden in a thicket while watching a rabbit come into view, totally unaware of her presence. Which meant she couldn't afford to disgrace herself. With effort, she went to take a piece of meat from the table, but even lifting her arm was bothersome, and she was unable to reach the plate. "What, drunk already?"
"Hey, you don't look so well-"
"Holo!"
"..."
"... Mngh."
"... Why should that be, I wonder?"
"not festival days."
"..."
"... Hmph. That shepherdess, eh..."
"... !"
"... Nn..."
"Why didn't you tell me you weren't feeling well?"
"..."
"You're not a child. I assume you're not going to claim you didn't notice how bad you felt until you fell over, are you?"
"Don't tell me the meat and wine was just so damned important-"
"Wha-!"
"... I'm sorry. That was wrong of me to say,"
"I would never-"
"I was very worried. What would you have done if we'd been traveling?"
"... I am sorry,"
"No... it's all right, so long as you're well. You haven't... caught cold or gotten sick... have you?"
"I was just... a bit fatigued."
"I thought as much. I think I would've been able to tell if you'd been sick."
"I just wondered if maybe..."
"?"
"... If maybe you'd eaten an onion or some such."
"I'm... not a dog, you know."
"I know. You're a wisewolf."
"I do feel 'twas a waste of wine and food, though."
"You need not worry about that - I'm a merchant after all. I had the leftover food packed up for us."
"-Or at least, that's what I wish I could say."
"Ah, it's just as I thought. You've got a fever. You must've been truly exhausted."
"It's because you're such a fool, that... I had to work so hard,"
"You've got to rein in that bravado."
"Honestly, it was quite an embarrassment to deal with in front of Norah."
"Anyway, I'll get you some more suitable comfort food, so make sure to rest and gather your strength, all right? Then you can have as much food and wine as you like."
"as much... as you like,"
"When you're so kind, I fear what'll happen next."
"That's my line,"
"You utter fool."
"Such a fool..."
"Hmph."
"Are you awake?"
"Can't you tell by looking?"
"How do you feel?"
"I cannot sit up."
"Indeed... your color's like a sheltered princess."
"Still, I'm hungry."
"Ha-ha. That's a relief."
"Well, then,"
"shall I have some porridge made?"
"I'm thirsty. Is that water there?"
"Ah, no - you had a fever yesterday, so I brought some apple wine."
"Ah, are you all right?"
"Mmph..."
"I am sorry,"
"If you were only half this agreeable normally,"
"Ah, but when I sleep agreeably in the wagon bed, you turn angry."
"Well, isn't it unfair that I should be the only one awake?"
"Also, if I were too agreeable, you'd eat most of the food at mealtimes."
"Obviously - I'm bigger."
"I'll just have to grow my demeanor to match."
"Guh, huh?"
"What's wrong?"
"Ugh... the flavor, it's..."
"Oh, I thinned it,"
"Aye, and too much. I thought my nose had gone stupid!"
"You had a fever, didn't you? Hence, thinned apple wine."
"Oh, right. Don't you know about that?"
"I'm a wisewolf - I know enough about the world to know there are things I don't know."
"There's a field called 'medicine' that's been built up from people-accumulated knowledge over the years. When you collapsed, I went to the trade house and thankfully was able to look through a translation of a book on the subject."
"And what's this about?"
"Well, there are four humors in the body and four temperaments."
"Oh?"
"The four humors are blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm,"
"Sickness happens when these humors fall out of balance - when you're fatigued or breathe bad air or sometimes when the movements of the stars influence them."
"Hmm. Aye, I understand that."
"When the full moon comes out and my body tingles and throbs, say."
"A-ah, yes, well, there is that, too. Just like the tides. So then, when the humors become unbalanced, you need to rebalance them by bleeding and the like."
"... Humans have the strangest notions."
"If you have a blister or boil, you lance it, do you not?"
"Wha-!"
"Humans do, which heals them. Sounds nice, eh?"
"That's one way of restoring balance, but it must be performed by a doctor. But if they saw your ears and tail, who knows what mad disease they'd think you have, and what a fuss that would cause. So we can't see a doctor. We'll just have to cure you another way - by using the four temperaments."
"And by that you mean delight, rage, sorrow, pleasure - all the emotions, right?"
"Close, but not quite. The human body has four temperaments: hot, cold, dry, and wet."
"Also, you can affect those states with what you eat - because there are hot foods, cold foods, dry foods, and wet foods. Since you were hot, something cold - like an apple - is just right."
"Well, if that's the case, I would've preferred a simple raw apple."
"No, that's no good. Apples are cold, but medicinally speaking they're also dry. People who're feeling poorly are already overdry, so you have to reverse that. And for that, you need a drink."
"And so do you plan on making me eat anything else?"
"Yes, because you collapsed from exhaustion. Since you had a fever from the accumulated fatigue, first we had to cool you. Next, your body is too dry, so we need to replenish its moisture. When you run, you get thirsty, right? But moistening the body also cools it, and if you become too cool, you'll turn melancholy, so we must then warm you. Then..."
"So then, yes. We'll take some porridge made with grain and sheep's milk, add some sliced apples, and top it with cheese. Now with this, first the apples-"
"Aye, that will do. I'd like to eat that. Nay, I fear I'll faint again if I don't. Do you want to see? See how pale I look. Hurry, you - go and bring it!"
"... You're perfectly well again, aren't you?"
"Ooh, I'm so dizzy..."
"Hurry and fetch it, will you?"
"Honestly... well, are you done with the apple wine?"
"Mm, yes, well, I think I've had enough,"
"And make it a big serving of porridge, too,"
"Can you sit up?"
"Honestly - if I ever fall ill, I expect you to return the favor."
"Aye, so long as you don't mind treatment in the style of the wolves of Yoitsu."
"Ah, 'tis well. My nose is very keen - I'll know long before you turn this poorly and do something about it."
"Still, I'm sorry I didn't notice. But I wish you'd have said something. In any case, yes - I'm rather thick,"
"You surely are. I might have a much more serious sickness, and you'd doubtless still fail to notice."
"Huh?"
"'Tis nothing. Never mind. Now food!"
"You're quite the princess this morning,"
"Would you kindly spoon-feed me?"
"'Twould have been better with more apples."
"Likely. Cold apples increase one's melancholy."
"Are you... mph... are you saying I'm too cheerful?"
"Also, recall how many apples I ate earlier in town."
"Ah, yes! You couldn't even finish them, so that's why you turned so melancholy."
"Mm."
"I don't want to eat any more apples for a while,"
"Still, if you can eat this much, you're on the mend. Tomorrow or the next day you should be well again,"
"Not that there's any need to rush. We'll be on the wagon again for quite some time once we leave. Might as well rest up."
"... I'm sorry to have... delayed our travel,"
"I gave up on hurrying when I picked you up. And they say hard times make for stronger foundations, don't they? I regained my good credit in this town, and it's probably better than it ever was. When I think about that profit, what's two or three more days?"
"Still, you-"
"Hmm?"
"The inn's just... too quiet, so..."
"It's true, sleeping on the cart is much noisier. Anyway, I've nothing to do today. And I've got to consult on the evening menu for a certain big eater I know, so..."
"So, have you any rough preferences? I'll look up the details in the medicine book later, but once the market closes, I won't be able to buy ingredients."
"Mm. Hmm..."
"You seem well. You might not be completely better, though, so heavy things are right out."
"Meat, too?"
"Certainly not. Porridge or soup made from boiled bread..."
"Hmph. Well, then, more of that - what was it, sheep's milk?"
"I liked its sweet scent and thick flavor. It will do."
"Sheep's milk, eh...?"
"Is there some problem?"
"It spoils quickly, so good-quality milk can be hard to find in the afternoon. You'll want it fresh, yes?"
"Naturally."
"Well, perhaps I'll have Norah get it for me again. Being a shepherd, she's got an eye for that kind of..."
"Did you say Norah?"
"No, it... it was for you. I needed to get good milk, so I thought-"
"If you'd just spend the money, you don't need a damned eye for sheep,"
"Su-surely there's no reason not to hire her as a guide. And anyway-"
"And anyway, why do you hate Norah so much?"
"Wh-what did you say?"
"W-well, I... I mean, I don't know what happened between you and shepherds in the past, but I understand that you're a wolf and you just don't like them. But that doesn't mean you have to hate her so much. I mean, Norah's a shepherdess, but well..."
"... She's so sweet - surely there's an exception to every rule."
"Fool!"
"Listen, you-"
"I was in the wrong,"
"But like and dislike are not things felt with reason. I feel I've said this before."
"Yes, well, that's true, of course. I don't think you have to decide everything with reason,"
"And also, you-"
"When you take that down, would you come right back up?"
"... Yes, of course. The inn is rather too quiet and all."
"Well, then, I'll be right back. Would you like something to drink?"
"The thinned apple wine you gave me before would be nice. I need to get well as soon as I can, do I not?"
"So you just wait here, all right?"
"... Hmm?"
"Holo,"
"Miss Norah's come to visit you."
"How are you feeling?"
"'Tis nothing, just a bit of fatigue."
"I've been a bit starved for company, though. You see, there was something I've been wanting to ask you,"
"Huh? Something to ask... me?"
"If it's something I can answer, then... please do."
"What is the best way to lead sheep?"
"You need a generous heart."
"'Tis because sheep always think themselves so clever."
"You're such a fool,"
"Hey, let's go sliding!"
