New Convo:

"So that's the last, then?"
"Hm, looks like... seventy pelts, on the nose. Always a pleasure."
"Hey, anytime. You're the only one who'll come this far into the mountains, Lawrence. I should be thanking you."
"Ah, but for my trouble I get truly fine pelts. I'll come again."
"What's this?"
"... a knight?"
"You, there! What's your business here?"
"I am Lawrence, a traveling merchant. Do you require my service?"
"A merchant? There's no town in the direction you came from, mer- chant,"
"Care for one?"
"Mmm,"
"A half-day's travel east of here there's a small village in the moun- tains. I was trading salt there."
"Ah. I see you've a load in your cart. Salt as well?"
"No, but furs. Look,"
"Mm. And this?"
"Ah, this is wheat I received from the village."
"Hm. Very well. You may pass."
"Yes, sir,"
"So, what occasions your post here, sir knight?"
"Mmm. Delicious. I should thank you."
"The monks have caught wind of a big pagan festival that's ap- proaching. Thus the increased guard. Do you know anything of this festival?"
"Sadly, I know nothing."
"Perhaps it truly is being held in secret, then. Pagans are a cowardly lot, after all."
"Still, a pagan festival, they say?"
"pagan festival."
"Business everywhere will suffer,"
"Ho there, good work!"
"What's that?"
"Might you tell me where to find Yarei?"
"Oh, Yarei'll be over yonder - see where the crowd is gathering? That field. It's all youngsters at his place this year. Whoever's slowest will wind up being the Holo!"
"There's a wolf! A wolf!"
"A wolf lies there!"
"Who will be the last and catch the wolf? Who, who, who?"
"It's the last bundle!"
"Mind you, don't cut too far!"
"Holo flees from the greedy hand!"
"Who, who, who will catch the wolf?"
"It's Yarei! Yarei, Yarei, Yarei!"
"Awooooooo!"
"It's Holo! Holo, Holo, Holo!"
"Awooooooo!"
"Holo the wolf is here! Holo the wolf is here!"
"Catch it, now! Catch it quick!"
"Don't let it escape!"
"Nothing for it, I suppose..."
"just in case she turns human on you."
"disaster"
"..."
"Hey."
"Hey, you there,"
"... hrm?"
"Hey, you there. What are you playing at, sleeping in someone's cart?"
"Mm... hah..."
"You there, what are you doing, climbing in my wagon bed?"
"Auwoooooooooooo!"
"... Hmph. 'Tis a good moon. Have you no wine?"
"I have none. And what are you? Why do you sleep in my cart? Were you to be sold in town? Did you escape?"
"What, so you have no wine? Food, then...? My, such waste,"
"Are you some kind of demon?"
"Ah-ha-ha-ha! Me, a demon now?"
"H-how is that so amusing?"
"Oh, it's amusing, it is! That is surely the first time I've been called a demon."
"What are you?"
"Me?"
"Who but you would I be talking to?"
"The horse, say."
"..."
"What are you, I say!"
"Drawing a blade on me now? How lacking in manners."
"What?!"
"Mm. Ah, I see. My escape was successful. My apologies! I had for- gotten,"
"I am called Holo. It has been some time since I've taken this form, but, well, it is quite nice."
"Holo?"
"Mm, Holo. A good name, no?"
"What a coincidence. I also know of one that goes by Holo."
"escaped successfully."
"Oh, ho, I have never met another Holo. Whence do they hail?"
"It is the name of this area's harvest god. Are you a god?"
"I have long been bound to this place and called its god. But I am nothing so great as a deity. I am merely Holo."
"By 'long,' do you mean that you were born here?"
"Oh, no."
"I was born far to the north."
"The north?"
"Indeed. The summers there are short and the winters long. A world of silver."
"Have you ever been there?"
"I've been as far as Arohitostok. The year-round blowing snow is terrifying."
"Hm. Haven't heard of it,"
"What places do you know?"
"A place called Yoitsu."
"Don't know it,"
"Were you born there?"
"I was. How is Yoitsu doing these days? Is everyone well?"
"Do you remember any other places?"
"Mmm... it's been so many centuries... ah, Nyohhira, there was a town called Nyohhira. It was a strange town, with hot springs. I would often go to bathe in them."
"Mm. I do not mind taking human form, but it is unavoidably cold. Not enough fur,"
"You said something about changing forms earlier - what was that about? At his question, Holo poked her head out of the pile. "I meant just what I said. I haven't taken human form in some time. Charming, no?"
"Aside from a few extra details, you're a human. Or what else? Are you a dog turned human, like the stories of horses turning human?"
"You can doubtless tell from my ears and tail that I am a proud wolf! My fellow wolves, the animals of the forest, and the people of the vil- lage all acknowledge me. It is of the white tip of my tail that I am proudest. My ears anticipate every misfortune and hear every lie, and I have saved many friends from many dangers. When one speaks of the Wisewolf of Yoitsu, they speak of none other than me!"
"No, it can't be,"
"Holo, was it?"
"Yes?"
"You said you were a wolf."
"I did."
"But all you have are a wolf's ears and tail. If you are truly a trans- formed wolf, you should be able to take a wolf's form."
"Oh, you're telling me to show you my wolf form."
"I don't want to,"
"Why not?"
"Why do you want me to?"
"If you were a person I would consider turning you in to the Church. Demons cause calamity, after all. But if you are really Holo, god of the harvest, in human form, then I needn't turn you in."
"From what I have heard, transformed animals can change to their original forms. If you are telling the truth, you should be able to do so as well, yes?"
"I have suffered many times at the hand of the Church. I'll not be given over to them. Yet-"
"No animal can change its form without a token. Even you humans need makeup be- fore you can change your appearance. Likewise, I require food."
"What kind of food?"
"Only a bit of wheat."
"That, or fresh blood."
"Fresh... blood?"
"Only a bit, though."
"What, are you afraid?"
"Of course not,"
"If you are, then I'm even more disinclined to."
"Why, then?"
"Because you will surely quake with fear. All, be they human or an- imal, look on my form and give way with awe, and treat me as special. I have tired of this treatment."
"Are you saying I would be afraid of your true form?"
"If you would pretend to be strong, you might first hide your trem- bling hand!"
"Heh. You're an honest sort,"
"However, just because you are hon- est does not mean I should show you my form. Was what you said be- fore the truth?"
"Before?"
"That if I am truly a wolf, you would not give me over to the Church."
"Mm..."
"Well, I have a good eye for both men and beasts. You are a man who keeps his word, I can tell."
"I'll show you a bit, then. A full transformation is difficult. You'll for- give me if I only do my arm,"
"What are you doing with that?"
"Uh, uughh..."
"Mm... whew. It really doesn't look very good."
"Well? Do you believe me now?"
"Uh... er..."
"Aren't you the doubtful one. If you still think it's an illusion, go ahead and touch it,"
"Oh-"
"Wha-! What is it?"
"Mm, oh, nothing. Don't be so surprised!"
"So, what happened?"
"Mm,"
"Be gentle, will you?"
"You're rather charming, aren't you?"
"Are you really a god...?"
"I'm no god. As you can tell from my forepaw, I am merely bigger than my comrades - bigger and cleverer. I am Holo the Wisewolf!"
"wise"
"So, what think you?"
"But... the real Holo should be in Yarei now. The wolf resides in the one who cuts the last wheat stalk, they say..."
"Heh-heh-heh. I am Holo the Wisewolf! I know well my own limita- tions. It is true that I live within the wheat. Without it, I cannot live. And it is also true that during this harvest I was within the last wheat to be harvested, and usually I cannot escape from there. Not while any were watching. However, there is an exception."
"If there is nearby a larger sheaf of wheat than the last one to be har- vested, I can move unseen to that wheat. That's why they say it, you know, the villagers. 'If you cut too greedily, you won't catch the harvest god, and it will escape.'"
"So that is how it was done. I suppose one could call you my savior. If you hadn't been there, I would never have escaped."
"savior"
"Perhaps I should take that wheat back to the village, then. They'll be in a bad way without their harvest god. I've been friends with Yarei and others in Pasloe for a long time. I'd hate to see them suffer."
"You... you're jesting, surely,"
"Hard to say,"
"Please, help me... won't you?"
"I must ask you one thing."
"... all right."
"If you leave the village, will they still be able to raise wheat?"
"Er... what's wrong?"
"The village's abundant harvests will continue without me,"
"Is that so?"
"Long did I stay in that village; as many years as I have hairs on my tail. Eventually I wished to leave, but for the sake of the village's wheat I stayed. Long ago, you see, I made a promise with a youth of the vil- lage, that I would ensure the village's harvest. And so I kept my promise."
"I... I am the wolf that lives in the wheat. My knowledge of wheat, of things that grow in the ground, is second to none. That is why I made the village's fields so magnificent, as I promised. But to do that, occa- sionally the harvest must be poor. Forcing the land to produce re- quires compensation. But whenever the harvest was poor, the villagers attributed it to my caprices, and it has only gotten worse in recent years. I have been wanting to leave. I can stand it no longer. I long ago fulfilled my promise."
"The village's good harvests will continue. There will be a poor yield every few years, but that will be their own doing. And they'll overcome it on their own. The land doesn't need me, and the people certainly don't need me either."
"In any case, setting aside the question of whether or not that's all true..."
"You think me a liar?"
"Sorry,"
"I understand your resentment. But where do you plan to go, having left the village?"
"I wish to return north,"
"North?"
"My birthplace. The forest of Yoitsu. So many years have passed that I can no longer count them... I wish to return home."
"But I'd like to travel a bit. I've come all the way to this distant place, after all. And surely much has changed over the months and years, so it would be good to broaden my perspective,"
"So long as you'll not take me back to Pasloe or turn me in to the Church, I'd like to travel with you. You're a wandering merchant, are you not?"
"I cannot make this decision quickly."
"It is good to be cautious. But I never misread a person. I don't believe you're so cold as to turn someone away."
"Enough talk for today."
"Surely you'll not tell me to sleep outside,"
"Hey, now! Those are mine!"
"Hm? Oh, you are awake. What think you of this? Does it look good?"
"The greatcoat is black - my brown hair looks lovely against it, eh? These trousers, though - they get in the way of my tail. Might I put a hole in them?"
"Hrm. Well, fortunately they're still large. I'll find a way to make them work."
"You're a merchant through and through, that's sure enough. I know just what you anticipate with that expression on your face,"
"I'll not run. If that had been my aim, I'd have gone long since."
"So, I wish to travel with you. May I?"
"This must be some kind of fate. Very well,"
"You'll have to earn your keep, though. The life of a merchant isn't easy. I expect the god of abundant harvests to bring an abundant har- vest to my coin purse."
"I'm not so shameless as to thoughtlessly freeload. I'm Holo the Wisewolf, and I have my pride,"
"Though this proud wolf made a bit of a spectacle of herself yesterday,"
"In any case, it is good to meet you... er..."
"Lawrence. Kraft Lawrence. When I'm working I go by Lawrence."
"Mm. Lawrence. I shall sing your praises for all eternity,"
"At any rate, it will soon rain. We should make haste."
"Wha...? You should have said so sooner!"
"The river is in a foul temper. 'Twould be best to cross a short dis- tance from here."
New Convo:

"Ha-ha, the cool water soothes my burns, it does,"
"The furs will be all right, surely. They were good marten skins, and martens live in the mountains, mountains where my kind live as well."
"Will they sell high?"
"I hardly know. I'm no fur merchant, am I?"
"Oh, that's right,"
"What shall we do with that wheat sheaf?"
"Mm, what do you mean, 'what'?"
"I mean, shall we thresh it, or shall we leave it as it is? Assuming the talk of you residing in the wheat is true, that is. Lawrence was teasing Holo, but she only cracked a slight smile. "As long as I live, the wheat will neither rot nor wither. But should it be burned, eaten, or ground into the soil, I will likely disappear. If it's in the way, you could thresh it and keep it safe somewhere; that might be better."
"I see. I'll thresh it and put the grains in a pouch, then. You should hold it, right?"
"'Twould be a boon. Still better to hang it 'round my neck,"
"I'd hoped to sell some of it elsewhere, though. Could we set aside a bit for sale?"
"Most of the crops grew well because of the region. They'll soon wither - that's the point. No use taking them elsewhere."
"Let's go dry ourselves in the great room. With this rain, there should be plenty of other people gathering around the furnace."
"Mm, a good idea, that,"
"What's so funny?"
"Heh, I would never have thought to cover up my face because of burns."
"Oh? What would you have done? "The burns would become part of me, just like my ears or tail. Proof of my uniqueness."
"I know what you are thinking,"
"Want to injure me and see for yourself?"
"I'm a man. I could never injure such a beautiful face."
"You may have been caught in the rain, but you still smell foul. A wolf can tell these things."
"Why, you-"
"Even a wolf knows to keep its coat clean. You're a good man, aye, but you need to keep neat. He didn't know whether she was joking or not, but hearing it from a girl like Holo made it impossible to deny. For as long as he could re- member, Lawrence maintained his appearance only in so far as it would help his professional negotiation, with no thought given to whether it would appeal to a woman. Had his negotiation partner been a woman, he might have taken the trouble, but unfortunately, he had not once met a female merchant. He didn't know how to answer, so he simply turned around and fell silent. "The beard, though, is quite nice."
"I daresay I'd prefer it a big longer, though."
"... Like so, like a wolf."
"There will be many people around the furnace. Best not to let any- thing slip."
"I am Holo the Wisewolf! Long ago I traveled clear to Pasloe in hu- man form. Worry not!"
"Aha, so you're here from Yorenz, then?"
"Yes. I delivered salt from there to my customer and got marten furs in trade."
"great hall,"
"Still, going all the way back to Yorenz, isn't that rather arduous?"
"That depends on how canny the merchant."
"Oh ho, interesting!"
"When I bought the salt in Yorenz, I paid no money. Rather, I'd already sold a measure of wheat to a different branch of the same 52/209 company in another city - but when I sold the wheat, I took no pay- ment; neither did I pay for the salt. So I completed two separate deals with no money exchanged."
"I see... what a strange contrivance,"
"I live in the city of Perenzzo, and my vineyard has never employed such a method when selling our grapes. Will we be all right?"
"This barter system was invented by merchants who needed a con- venient way to deal with people from many different lands. As the owner of a vineyard, you'd need to be careful not to let vintners claim your grapes to be poor and buy them cheaply."
"Yes. We have such arguments every year,"
"Lawrence, was it? Next time you're in Perenzzo, do come by for a visit."
"I shall, thank you."
"Well then, as my wife appears tired, I'll take my leave of you."
"May God allow us to meet again,"
"Heh-heh, you're not a man to be trifled with, master!"
"I'm merely a traveling merchant like any other,"
"Far from it, master. I'd been wanting to speak with him for some time but couldn't find the opportunity. Yet you slipped right in. Think- ing that it's traders like you that I'll be going up against in the future, why, it's hard not to despair."
"That's nothing - when I was starting out, all the established mer- chants seemed like monsters to me. Half of them still do. But I'm still eating. You just have to keep at it."
"Heh-heh, it's a relief to hear you say so, sir. Oh, by the way, I'm Zheren - and you've probably figured it out, but I'm just starting out as a merchant. Begging your indulgence, sir!"
"I'm Lawrence."
"So, then... is this your companion?"
"My wife, Holo."
"My, a wife and a merchant both?"
"She is an eccentric and prefers the wagon to the village home."
"Still, covering your wife in a cloak this way, she must be very pre- cious to you."
"Heh-heh, but it is a man's instinct to want to see hidden things. God has led us together here. Surely you can let me have a look at her."
"The traveler is happiest before the journey; the dog's bark fiercer than the dog itself, and a woman most beautiful from behind. To show 55/209 my face in public would dash many dreams, and thus 'tis something I cannot do,"
"Heh-heh... your wife is something else, master."
"It's all I can do to avoid being quite henpecked."
"Yes, well... it's certainly providential that I've met the both of you. Can you spare a moment to hear my tale?"
"Hm? Something smells good,"
"Wha... oh. The wheat."
"And here's a strap, so you can work out a way to hang it around your neck."
"Mm. My thanks. But this takes precedence,"
"So wolves find potatoes delicious, do they?"
"Aye. It is not as though we wolves eat meat year-round. We eat tender buds from trees. We eat fish. And the crops that humans raise are better still than tree buds. Also, I rather like the human habit of putting meat and vegetables to a fire."
"Whew. Rather surprising, that. Human throats are so narrow. It's rather inconvenient."
"Wolves swallow things whole, right?"
"Mm. Well, we lack this, so we cannot chew at our leisure."
"But I've choked on potatoes in the past, it's true."
"Oh ho."
"I suppose potatoes and I are ill-fated."
"Earlier,"
"you said something about being able to tell when someone is lying?"
"There are still fleas."
"It's that nice fur of yours. I bet it's a lovely bed for them."
"Well, it's a credit to your eye for quality that you can tell as much, then!"
"So is it true that you can tell truth from lies?"
"Hm? Oh, more or less."
"So, how good at it are you?"
"Well, I know that what you said about my tail just now was not meant as praise."
"It's not perfect, though. You may believe me or not... as you wish,"
"So let me ask you this - was the lad's story true?"
"The lad?"
"The one who spoke to us by the furnace."
"Oh. Heh, 'lad,' you say."
"Is something funny?"
"From where I stand you're both but lads."
"Heh. I daresay you're a bit more grown than he, though. As for your lad, it seems to me he is lying."
"I don't know which part is a lie, though, nor do I understand the finer points of the conversation."
"Well, currency speculation isn't rare in and of itself. Still..."
"You don't understand why he's lying... no?"
"When someone's lying, what's important is not the content of the lie, but the reasoning behind it,"
"How many years do you think it took me to understand that?"
"Oh? You may have called that Zheren person a lad, but you're both the same to me,"
"If I were not here, what would you do?"
"First I'd work out whether it was true or not, then I'd pretend to be- lieve his story."
"And why is that?"
"If it's true, I can turn a profit just by going along with it. If it's a lie, then someone somewhere is up to something - but I can still come out ahead if I keep my eyes and ears open."
"Mm. And given that I am here, and I've told you he's lying, then..."
"Hm?"
"Ah."
"Heh. See, there was nothing over which to agonize so. Either way you'll be pretending to accept his proposal,"
"I'll be taking that last potato,"
"I am Holo the Wisewolf! How many times longer do you think I have lived than you?"
"Lord, grant my husband courage."
"It's gotten a bit more important, the Church has,"
"The Church has always been important."
"Hardly. It was not so when I came through here from the north. They'd always be going on about how the one god and his twelve 61/209 angels created the world and how humanity was but borrowing it. Nature is not something created, though. Even then, I thought to my- self, 'When did these people learn to tell such jokes?'"
"I suppose this is a sign of the times, then... much has changed."
"Have you yourself changed?"
"..."
"Then I'm sure your homeland hasn't changed, either."
"'Twould be a disgrace to the name Wisewolf to be comforted by you, though,"
"Hey, what keeps you? Hurry!"
"Well then, I'll be on my way. When you arrive in Pazzio, find a tav- ern called Yorend; you'll be able to contact me there."
"Yorend, is it? Very well."
"Are we not going with him?"
"It rained all day yesterday, so he'll make better time on foot than we can on the wagon. There's no need for him to slow down on our account."
"True, merchants are always on about time."
"Time is money."
"Ho-ho! An interesting saying. Time is money, is it?"
"As long as we have time, we can make money."
"'Tis true. Though it's not how I think,"
"I imagine the farmers you watched over for so many centuries were mindful of time."
"I'll let you have that one,"
"Hmph. At what have you been looking? The farmers care nary a whit for time. It's the air they're mindful of."
"I don't follow you."
"They wake in the dawn air, work the farm in the morning air, pull the weeds in the afternoon air, twist rope in the rainy air. They worry over their crops in the windy air, watch them grow in the summer air, celebrate the harvest in the autumn air, and in the winter air they wait for spring. They think not of time - like me, they note only the air."
"You're quick enough, but you lack experience."
"Still, one will grow wiser with age."
"How many hundreds of years do you think it will take?"
"Ah-ha-ha-ha! You are rather quick, aren't you?"
"Perhaps you're just old and slow."
"Heh-heh. Do you know why we wolves attack people in the mountains?"
"Er, no."
"It is because we wish to eat human brains and gain their know- ledge."
"You're still a pup. Hardly a match for me."
"Still, have you ever been attacked by wolves in the mountains?"
"I have. Perhaps... eight times."
"They're quite difficult to handle, are they not?"
"They are. Wild dogs I can handle, but wolves are a problem."
"That's because they want to eat lots of humans, to get their-"
"I'm sorry, all right? So stop."
"Oh..."
"I am sorry,"
"... Are you angry?"
"Yes, I'm angry."
"I am angry. No more jokes like that,"
"Wolves live only in the mountains, but dogs have lived with humans. That's why wolves make tougher opponents."
"Hm?"
"Wolves only know that they are hunted by humans, and that they are terrifying creatures. So we are always thinking about what to do when they enter our forest."
"Did you ever-"
"There are some things I simply cannot answer."
"Oh."
"Sorry."
"Now we're even."
"The worlds we live in, you and I, are very different,"
New Convo:

"Have they no king here?"
"Is this your first time coming to a city of this size?"
"Times surely change. In my day, a city this large would have been ruled by a king."
"Heh. I'll just say that your intentions are admirable,"
"This isn't... a festival, is it?"
"If it were a Church celebration day, the streets would be so crowded we couldn't pass through them. Today, though, there's still space."
"Ho. Difficult to imagine that,"
"Hey."
"Mm?"
"Will it be all right, not covering your head?"
"Huh? Head?"
"I know it's festival time in Pasloe right now, so most of the villagers will be drinking and celebrating - but not all of them, and some of the ones who don't may be visiting Pazzio right now."
"Oh, that,"
"Even if they could see my ears, nobody would notice. They've all long forgotten about me."
"You lived there for hundreds of years - surely there are some le- gends passed down about you. Or did you never take human form?"
"There are legends. And sometimes I'd appear as a human."
"So there are stories about you appearing as a human?"
"As far as I remember, it went something like this. She looks like a beautiful girl of about fifteen. She has long, flowing brown hair and wolf ears, along with a white-tipped tail. Sometimes she would ap- pear in this form, and in exchange for keeping her appearance a secret, she promises a good harvest."
"Happy?"
"Well, it sounds like you pretty much told them everything about yourself. Is that really okay?"
"Even if they were to see my ears or tail, they would doubt - just as you did. They'll never realize the truth."
"Hey..."
"Mm?"
"Even... even should they see me, they won't know who I am... will they?"
"It is certainly my hope that they won't,"
"You needn't worry."
"There's quite a collection of fruit! Are they all picked nearby?"
"It's because Pazzio is the gateway to the south. When the season's right, you can even see fruit from regions nearly impossible to visit."
"There is much fruit in the south, and good."
"Surely you have fruit in the north as well."
"Aye, but it's tough and bitter. To make it sweet it must be dried and cured. We wolves can't do such work, so we have to take it from the villages."
"I would think wolves would prefer spicy things. It's bears that crave sweets."
"We don't like spicy food. Once we found red fang-shaped fruit among the cargo of a shipwreck. We ate it and regretted it loud and long!"
"Ah, hot peppers. Expensive, those."
"We dunked our heads in the river and decided humans were terri- fying indeed,"
"If it's red fruit we're talking about, I'd rather have those,"
"Oh, those are fine apples."
"Are they not?"
"They look rather toothsome, no?"
"Indeed."
"Now that I think of it, I had a friend who invested more than half his worth in apples. I'm not sure where they were from, but if they turned out like these, he's surely doubled his money."
"I should've done the same."
"that's not the point I was try- ing to make,"
"Hmph. Well... that's most unfortunate,"
"But the risk was very high. If it were me, I would've transported them by ship."
"A... ship, you say?"
"You see, a group of merchants will sometimes pool their money to hire a ship. The amount of money they raise determines the amount and type of cargo, but unlike land transport, if there is an accident you may lose lives as well as money. Even a strong wind can put you in danger. However, there is profit to be had. I've twice traveled by sea this way, so..."
"Mm... ah..."
"What's wrong? They passed the apple booth, and it began to recede behind them. There is nothing more fun than knowing the heart of another. Lawrence smiled his best merchant smile. "Right, so about shipping..."
"Mm... apples..."
"Hm?"
"I... I want... I want apples..."
"Earn your own food, why don't you."
"You... munch... earlier, you... mmph... pretended like you didn't... chomp... notice!"
"It's amusing knowing what someone else is thinking,"
"Mine!"
"Hey, I paid for them."
"I'm Holo the Wisewolf! I can make this much money any time I want."
"Don't let me stop you. I'd planned to use that money for lodging tonight."
"Mmph... grm... But, I... munch..."
"Answer once you're done eating, please."
"... Whew."
"You certainly ate a lot."
"Apples are the devil's fruit, full of tempting sweetness as they are."
"Shouldn't a wisewolf be able to conquer temptation?"
"While one may lose much because of avarice, nothing was ever ac- complished by abstinence."
"So, what was that you were going to say earlier?"
"Hm? Oh, yes. I've no money and no immediate means to earn money, so as you do business I'll just put a few words in to help you bring in more profit. Agreed?"
"agreed"
"You'll soon be selling the marten furs, yes?"
"Today, hopefully. No later than tomorrow."
"Well, I'll try to say something to bring your profit up, if I can. Whatever the difference I make, I keep,"
"Agreed."
"It's done, then!"
"But this isn't just limited to our pelts. You're a merchant, too - there may be no chance for me to talk up our price."
"How modest of you."
"Wisdom is knowing thyself first."
"Welcome to the Milone Trading Company!"
"I've sold wheat here before, but today I have furs to sell. Will you take a look?"
"Yes, yes, but of course! The man inside and to the left will be happy to see you."
"Ho there, sir, where are you headed?"
"Is he a knight?"
"We're here to sell furs. I was told to come to the left side of the shop."
"Right, then, I'll just take your horse. This way, if you please."
"Ho-ho, a good horse, sir! He looks stout of heart."
"He works without complaint; I'll say that much,"
"A horse that complains - now that would be something to see!"
"You're not kidding."
"Kraft Lawrence, I presume? We thank you for your patronage."
"I'm told you've come to sell furs today."
"Indeed I have. These are the very ones, here in the back of the wag- on, seventy total."
"Ho, these are good marten furs indeed. The year has been a good one for crops, so marten fur is scarce."
"You only see furs this fine once every several years. They were drenched with rain on the way here, but look - they've lost none of their luster."
"'Tis a fine luster, to be sure, and with good lie. What of their size?"
"Oh, ho. They're not lacking in size. You said you had seventy?"
"Well, then... Sir Lorentz... ah, my apologies, Sir Lawrence, you've come to trade with us because you sold wheat here in the past?"
"I can offer... say, one hundred thirty-two silver trenni."
"You don't see furs like these often. I brought them to you because I've done business with you in the past, but..."
"We certainly appreciate your business."
"For my part I'd like to continue our association."
"As would we, I assure you. In light of friendly relations, then, what say you to one hundred forty?"
"It's done, then,"
"Excuse me a moment,"
"I don't quite know - is that a good price?"
"Quite good, yes,"
"Well then, do we have an agreement?"
"Wait just a moment."
"Wha-"
"One hundred forty trenni, you said, yes?"
"Uh, er, yes. One hundred forty in silver trenni pieces,"
"Ah, perhaps you didn't notice?"
"My apologies, but have I overlooked something?"
"Mm. I can see you're a fine merchant, so surely you pretended not to notice? I can see I won't need to hold back with you."
"My intention is anything but, I assure you. If you'll kindly point out what you're speaking of, we will be happy to adjust the price appropriately..."
"Master,"
"It's not polite to make sport of people."
"master"
"Th-that was certainly not my aim. But perhaps you should be the one to tell him."
"Master, pass me a fur, if you please."
"Here."
"master."
"Thank you, master. Now, if you please, sir..."
"These are fine furs, as you can see,"
"I quite agree,"
"You won't see their like in many years. Or perhaps I should put it this way - you won't smell their like in many years."
"'Tis a scent, but to miss it you'd need to be blind!"
"Well, a smell is worth a thousand words. Would you care to sample the scent?"
"Oh? Smell something, do you?"
"Ah, er, yes. It smells like fruit, I'd say."
"Fruit indeed. Just as fur is scarce this year because of the harvest, so did the forest overflow with fruit. This marten was scampering about in that same forest until just a few days ago, and it ate so much of that plentiful fruit that the scent suffused its body."
"true enough."
"The truth is that while the fur's luster might be better or worse, it generally changes little. Does the problem not come, then, when the fur is made into clothing, when it is actually used? Good fur is durable; bad fur soon wears thin."
"True, as you say,"
"As you can tell, this particular fur has the sweet scent of marten that has eaten very well indeed. It took two strong men to pull the hide clear of the body, it was so tough."
"The fur is as strong as the beast itself was, and will keep the wearer as warm as a spring day, shedding rain from dawn 'til dusk. And don't forget the scent! Imagine coming across a perfumed piece of clothing like this among coats made from nose-wrinkling marten fur. Why, 'twould sell so dear your eyes would pop out."
"So, what do you think would be a fair price, then?"
"What say you to two hundred trenni?"
"Mmm,"
"How about three pieces for each fur - two hundred ten in total?"
"Er, well..."
"Master,"
"Perhaps we should try elsewhere-"
"Uh, no! Two hundred ten pieces, then!"
"master."
"You heard the man, master."
"Ah, wine!"
"What troubles you? Aren't you going to drink?"
"Have you ever worked as a merchant?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, have I injured your pride?"
"I don't know how many deals you've done in your life, but I watched countless transactions when I was in the village. Long ago, I once saw a man use that technique - I didn't invent it myself. When was that, anyway...?"
"I really hadn't noticed, though. Last night when I slept in the furs, I didn't smell any fruit."
"Oh, that. That was from the apples we bought."
"It's his own fault for being tricked,"
"He'll be impressed once he figures it out."
"... You may have a point."
"There's no point in being angry when you've been tricked. A real merchant knows to be impressed."
"That's quite a sermon. You sound like a wizened old trader."
"Heh. And you're just a babe in arms, yourself."
"All this aside, did you do as you were supposed to?"
"I asked around the Milone Company to see if anybody knew about nations that would be issuing new silver currency, but they didn't seem to be hiding anything. As long the information isn't something that needs to be monopolized, they'll normally share it. Makes for good business relations."
"Hm."
"But chances for this kind of deal aren't common. That's why we're involved."
"Still, whatever the trick, as long as we can avoid getting fleeced and come out ahead, we'll be fine. " Lawrence drank some wine and popped some beans into his mouth - Holo was paying, so he decided he might as well take advantage of it. "I don't see the owner anywhere. I wonder if he's out,"
"Zheren did say we could contact him through the bar. He must be on good terms with the establishment."
"Well, traveling merchants usually base their operations out of either a tavern or a trading house. In fact, I've got to get to a trading house later on. And the owner really isn't around, is he?"
"The owner?"
"He's gone to buy ingredients at the marketplace,"
"Do you have some business with him?"
"Could you possibly tell him we're trying to get in touch with a man named Zheren?"
"Oh, Mr. Zheren? I know of him."
"Do you?"
"He normally comes soon after sundown. Feel free to stay here until then."
"We'll take you up on that, then,"
"Do enjoy yourselves!"
"... That girl, she's lying,"
"Lying how?"
"Zheren doesn't necessarily come in here every day."
"Hm."
"Well, I hope we'll see Zheren soon, as she says."
"As do I,"
"I rejoice at our reunion!"
"How fared your furs?"
"They fetched a good price - as you can tell from the wine."
"I envy you! I daresay you had an angle?"
"That's a secret."
"Well, in any case, I'm glad you were able to sell them for a good price. For my part, more capital means more profit."
"Just because I have more capital doesn't mean I'll be increasing my investment."
"Say its not so! I've prayed for your good fortune in anticipation of just that! "Then you've been praying at the wrong place. You should've just prayed for me to up my investment."
"So, to business, then,"
"Ah, right."
"In exchange for selling me the information of which silver currency is due to become purer, you want a portion of the profit I'll make. Does that sum it up?"
"Indeed."
"Is this story of a purer coin true?"
"Well, I'm predicting it based on information I got from a small mining town. I think it's trustworthy, but... there are no guarantees in business."
"True enough."
"If you'd told me it was a sure thing, I'd have had to walk away. Nothing is more suspicious than a guarantee."
"So, what would you want for a percentage?"
"Ten trenni for the information, plus ten percent of your profit."
"That's a very conservative demand given the potential gain."
"It is. If you should take a loss, I won't be able to compensate you. If I had to, all my assets would be forfeit. So I'll take ten percent of whatever you make, but if you take a loss, I'll refund you the informa- tion fee, and no more."
"That sounds good enough to me."
"Oh, er, thank you very much!"
"Just to confirm, you want ten trenni to provide me with the inform- ation, and ten percent of my earnings. However, if I lose money, you'll return the fee to me, and you won't be liable for further losses."
"Yes."
"And we'll sign a contract to this effect before a public witness."
"Yes. As for the settlement day, can we make it three days before the spring market? I expect the currency to change within the year."
"That will do. It should be sufficient time."
"In that case, I look forward to seeing you at the public witness's of- fice early tomorrow morning."
"To profit for both of us!"
"To profit!"
"This is the silver the boy mentioned, yes?"
"It's a well-trusted coin in this region,"
"Trusted?"
"There are hundreds of currencies in the world, and the amount of gold or silver in each varies constantly. Trust is an important part of currency."
"Huh. I only knew of a few different kinds of money. It used to be that business was done in animal skins."
"So, how about it? Have you worked something out now that you know which coin he was talking about?"
"Well, there are several possibilities."
"For example?"
"W-well, be more careful."
"What's wrong?"
"Mm. I want to eat one of those."
"You want some bread?"
"Mm. That one, there, with the honey on it."
"You have money,"
"Go ahead and buy some if you want."
"I don't imagine bread and apples are far apart in price. Will you carry the mountain of bread I'll bring back with me? Or shall I ruin the baker's day by asking him for so much change?"
"All right, all right. I'll give you a smaller coin. Here, hold out your hands. One of these black coins should get you one loaf."
"You'd best not be cheating me,"
"Always with the quick tongue,"
"Don't bump into anybody else,"
"I don't want to have to deal with a fight."
"Don't treat me like a pup, then."
"Its hard to see you as anything else when your mouth is covered in sticky honey."
"..."
"Am I charming, then?"
"You certainly can't take a joke,"
"I'm a very serious person,"
"So, what was it you were thinking about?"
"Oh, right, right."
"So, back to the trenni coin. Zheren may well be telling the truth."
"Oh?"
"There are reasons to raise the silver content. So... here, take this coin, a silver firin. It's from a nation three rivers south of here. Its got a respectable silver content and is quite popular in the marketplace. You could say it's the trenni's rival."
"Huh. Seems one thing never changes: a nation's power is in its money."
"Exactly. Nations do not always fight through strength of arms. If your country's currency is overwhelmed by a foreign coin, you've been just as thoroughly conquered. All the foreign king needs to do is cut off your supply of money, and your marketplace will die. Without money, you can neither buy nor sell. They control your economy."
"So they're increasing the silver content in order to gain advantage over their rival,"
"I suppose my ears aren't completely omniscient."
"It's entirely possible that Zheren wasn't actually lying,"
"Mm. I quite agree."
"What, did you think I was going to be angry?"
"I surely did."
"Well, I might be angry at that!"
"In any case, Zheren might not have been lying."
"Hmm. So where are we going now?"
"Now that we know which coin to look into, we're going to look into it."
"So, to the mint?"
"If a merchant like me showed up at the mint, the only greeting I'd get would be the business end of a spear. No, we're going to see the cambist."
"Huh. I guess there are things even I don't know."
"Once we're there, we'll see how the coin has been performing recently."
"What do you mean?"
"When a currency's value changes drastically, there are always signs."
"Like the weather before a storm?"
"Something like that. When the purity is going to increase a lot, it increases a little at a time, and when it's going to drop, it will drop gradually."
"Mmm..."
"Currency is based on trust. Relative to the absolute value of the gold or silver in them, coins are obviously more highly valued. Of course, the value is set very carefully, but since what you're actually doing is arbitrarily assigning a value to something with no inherent worth, you can think of it as a ball of trust. In fact, as long as the changes to a coin's purity aren't large, they're impossible to detect. Even a cambist has difficulty with it. You have to melt the coin down to be sure. But because a currency is based on trust, when it gains pop- ularity its actual value can exceed its face value - or do the opposite. There are many possible reasons for changes in its popularity, and one of the biggest is a change in the gold or silver purity of the coin. That's why people are so sensitive to changes in a currency - so sensitive that 97/209 even changes too small to detect with eyeglasses or a scale can still be considered major."
"Hmph. So when whoever makes the coins wants to change the pur- ity, first they'll make a minute change to see what the reaction is, then they'll adjust it up or down, yes?"
"Y-yeah, that's about right,"
"The human world certainly is complicated."
"Oh ho, it's quite crowded,"
"There are so many; how does one choose?"
"Any merchant worth his salt has a favorite cambist in each town. Follow me."
"Ah, there he is."
"Ho, Weiz. It's been a while,"
"Well, if it isn't Lawrence! It has indeed been a while! When did you get into town?"
"Just yesterday,"
"Took a detour from Yorenz to do some business."
"You never change, old friend. You look well!"
"I'm all right. How about yourself?"
"Hemorrhoids, my friend. Finally caught the curse of our trade! It's not pleasant."
"So, what brings you here today? Coming by at this hour means you must have need of my services, eh?"
"Yeah, actually, I have a favor to ask... uh, are you all right?"
"Who's the girl?"
"Picked her up in Pasloe on my way here."
"Huh. Picked her up, you say?"
"Well, more or less. Wouldn't you say?"
"Mm? Mm... might not be quite the word for it, but more or less, I'll allow,"
"So, what's your name, miss?"
"Mine? 'Tis Holo."
"Holo, eh? Good name."
"Well, if you have nowhere in particular to go, why not work here? I just happen to find myself in want of a maid. Someday you might fol- low in my footsteps, or perhaps even become my bride-"
"Weiz, I've come for a favor,"
"What? Have you already had your way with her?"
"had his way with her,"
"Well, then, you should let me have a go,"
"Oh, my,"
"We'll discuss that later. Busi- ness first."
"Hmph. Fine, then. What do you want?"
"Have you any recently minted trenni coins? If you can, I'd like the three most recently issued coins."
"What, do you know something about the purity changing?"
"Something like that,"
"Well, watch yourself, friend. 'Tisn't so easy to get ahead of the crowd,"
"So, do you have any or don't you?"
"I do indeed. There's a new coin came out just last month, at Ad- vent. Then the one before that... here it is."
"We handle money all day and haven't noticed anything. They're cast in the same mold, using the same ingredients. The lineup of artis- ans at the mint hasn't changed in years. There've been no coups, and there's no reason to change the coin,"
"It's no use, friend. If you could tell just by looking, we'd have no- ticed long ago,"
"Give it up,"
"Hm. What now, I wonder,"
"Don't want to melt them down, eh?"
"Don't be ridiculous. I can't do that,"
"Let me see them,"
"Oh, certainly, certainly,"
"Oh, sir, you're such a cad!"
"Can you tell something?"
"Well now, let's see,"
"Ha-ha, now that's impossible,"
"Hmm,"
"I cannot tell,"
"Oh, too bad! Too bad, indeed!"
"Well, we've wasted enough of your time,"
"We'll have a drink sometime."
"Indeed! That's a promise - a promise, you hear me!"
"He's an interesting sort!"
"For a matchless philanderer, I suppose so."
"So, what about the silver purity? Has it risen or fallen?"
"You've gotten quite good at ferreting the truth out, haven't you?"
"I'm the only one who knows about those ears of yours, after all. I know I saw them twitch."
"Can't let my guard down."
"But what surprised me is that you didn't say anything about it there. Your lie was unexpected."
"Whether or not he would've believed me, aside, we don't know what the other people nearby would've done. The fewer people as know a secret, the better, no? I suppose you can consider it compensation."
"Compensation?"
"You were a bit jealous back then, no? This is in exchange for that."
"Oh, don't worry about it. All men burn with foolish jealousy."
"But women are fools to take delight in it. This world is full of fools no matter where you look,"
"Though to me, you're both just lowly humans."
"Yet here you are, in human form. Best not bare your fangs now, in front of your beloved wolves."
"Ha, a flick of my lovely tail charms human and wolf alike!"
"Joking aside,"
"it was just a bit, but the new coins have a slightly duller sound."
"Duller?"
"Hmm... but if that's true, it's reasonable to assume that Zheren was lying all along,"
"I wonder. The boy will have to return your ten trenni, depending on how this plays out."
"I'd gotten that far. If he'd just wanted to swindle some money by selling bad information, he'd have done it at the church without going to all the trouble of meeting at a bar."
"'Tis a puzzlement."
"Well, Zheren brought me the deal, so he must have something to gain. He must."
"Assuming he's not some kind of fool,"
"He did mention not being responsible for losses. Which means..."
"Heh-heh,"
"What?"
"Heh. Ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha! You've been taken, my friend!"
"Taken?"
"Oh, yes."
"For... what? The ten trenni?"
"Hee-hee-hee. Forcing money out of someone isn't the only kind of swindle."
"What a scam! A plan where his opponent may or may not gain, but he is guaranteed to never lose!"
"That boy will never lose. In his worst case, his profit is zero. If silver drops, all he does is return your money to you. If it rises, he gets part of whatever you make. It's a business that requires no capital. Even if no profit appears, he'll be fine."
"Heh. Humans are pretty smart,"
"Although..."
"Isn't it quite common for the silver purity to drop slightly?"
"No, normally the purity is controlled with extreme care."
"Hm. And yet out of nowhere, there's a deal that hinges on the pur- ity of silver coins. Can that just be chance, I wonder?"
"Uh..."
"Now, you being in that village, at that time, with that sheaf of wheat - that was chance. There is nothing so hard as discerning chance from fate. It's harder than romance for a shut-in."
"That's a strange analogy,"
"You're lost in the maze of your own thoughts. When that happens, you need a new perspective. When I'm hunting prey, sometimes I'll climb a tree. The forest looks different from on high. For example"
"what if the person who's planning something isn't that kid?"
"Oh..."
"There's no reason Zheren's profit had to come from you. For ex- ample, perhaps he was hired by somebody else, and those wages mo- tivated him to pull you into the strange deal."
"If you're looking at a single withered tree, it can seem like a griev- ous wound to the forest. But from the forest's perspective, that tree's remains will nourish other plants, acting for the good of the whole forest. If you change your perspective, a situation right in front of you can reverse itself. So - have you seen anything new?"
"Heh. You've figured something out, have you?"
"Let's go."
"Hm? Uh, where?"
"The Milone Company. That's how the plan works. The more depreciating silver currency that can be bought up, the more profit there will be!"
New Convo:

"Will we be in time?"
"We should have enough time. That's why I came to the Milone Company in the first place."
"Is this company really so capable?"
"Doing business in foreign countries requires very keen ears - hear- ing merchants talking in a bar or customers in the market-place. If they weren't much better at collecting information than their competi- tion, they'd never be able to open up branches in foreign countries, much less have those branches flourish. The Milone Company is very good at this sort of thing. Investigating someone like Zheren is child's play for them."
"Huh."
"What is it?"
"You've had quite a bit,"
"The charms of wine are many."
"I suppose this is a good vintage. Normally I never drink anything so fine."
"Is that so?"
"When there's no money, I'll drink wine thick with grape drippings, wine so bitter it can't be drunk without adding sugar, honey, or ginger to it. Wine transparent enough to see the bottom of the cup is a true luxury."
"Hm. And I thought this was normal."
"Ha! Well, you're higher and mightier than I."
"What's wrong?"
"Are you angry because I said you have more status than I do?"
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it."
"You're a... how shall I say it? You're nothing special - wait, no, that's wrong. You're not a commoner. Ordinary? No, that's not it..."
"How inartic- ulate. You'll never attract a female that way."
"Urgh."
"I was right, eh?"
"Still, that was... immature of me."
"Sorry."
"I do truly dislike it, though. Younger wolves were friendly enough, but there was always a line. Weary of it, I left the forest. I suppose"
"I was looking for a friend."
"A friend, eh?"
"Mm."
"And did you find one?"
"Yes."
"He's a fellow from the village of Pasloe,"
"Oh, the one whose wheat you borrowed?"
"Mm. He's a bit foolish, but very cheerful. He wasn't the least bit surprised when he saw my wolf form. I suppose he is a bit odd, but a good fellow nonetheless."
"He really is a fool though. Sometimes I'm at a loss."
"Friends, eh?"
"We accept your proposal,"
"I am very grateful. May I assume that you've discovered who is backing Zheren?"
"He has the support of the Medio Company. I hardly need mention that they're the second-largest company in the city."
"The Medio Company, eh?"
"We believe there is a still-larger figure behind the Medio Company. With their resources alone, it would probably be impossible to enact the plan you've described. There is probably a nobleman operating be- hind the Medio Company, but there are many such figures who deal with them, and we've been unable to narrow it down to a single per- son. But as you yourself said, it won't matter as long as we're first to act."
"Well, then, shall we discuss how to split the profits? 117/209 It went without saying that these negotiations would give rise to his dreams. Seen off by all the employees of the Milone Company branch except the boss, Lawrence left humming a tune, unable to suppress his happiness. 118/209 He'd proposed that the company give him five percent of its profits from the currency exchange. This was a mere one-twentieth of its take, but Lawrence couldn't stop smiling. After all, if the Milone Company moved as he suggested, the amount of trenni silver that could be bought up was not one or two thousand, but rather two or three hundred thousand. If - as the rough estimates suggested - they exacted a ten-percent return from the deal, Lawrence's share could exceed a thousand coins of pure profit. If he topped two thousand coins, and wasn't too extravagant, he would be able to set up a shop in a town somewhere. However, when compared to the gain the Milone Company was anti- cipating, the profit made from unloading the silver coin was a mere bonus. They moved as a company, so such profits were insignificant. Lawrence could never actually hold that kind of gain. It was simply too huge and would never fit in his purse - but if the Milone Company could realize the profit, Lawrence would be owed a significant debt and, once he opened his shop, could make a large profit on that loan. So it was no surprise that he was humming so cheerfully. "You seem pleased,"
"I'd like to see the man who wouldn't be pleased at a time like this. This is the greatest day of my life."
"Well, I'm glad it's going so well,"
"I told you to go sleep in the hotel if you're feeling unwell."
"I was worried you'd get sucked into something unsavory unless I came with you."
"What do you mean?"
"Why, precisely what I said... urp."
"Honestly - just bear up a little longer. There's a shop ahead. We'll rest there."
"... All right."
"honestly,"
"Juice for one - any kind's fine - and bread for two,"
"Coming right up!"
"Your tolerance is far from weak - you drank a lot yesterday,"
"Uugh,"
"Here y'are, apple juice and two servings of bread."
"The bill?"
"You'll pay now, then? It comes to thirty-two lute."
"One moment, please,"
"A hangover, eh?"
"Too much wine,"
"Such are the mistakes of youth! It's the same with drinking as it is with anything else - there's a price. Plenty of young merchants stagger out of here with pale faces."
"Here you are, thirty-two lutes."
"So it is. You should rest here awhile. I take it you couldn't make it all the way back to your own inn?"
"Have some juice,"
"It was pressed at just the right time."
"Whew... I've not been hungover in centuries,"
"A hungover wolf is a sad sight indeed. I suppose I can imagine a bear drinking too much, but a wolf..."
"It was probably bears I drank with the most in the forest,"
"There was a bit of tribute from humans, too."
"No matter how many times I'm hungover, though, I never seem to learn."
"Humans are the same way,"
"Now that you mention it... what was I going to say? I had something to tell you, but now it's gone. I feel like it was something rather important, too..."
"Well, if it's that important, you'll remember eventually."
"Mmm... I suppose. Ugh. It's no good. I can't remember,"
"Anyway, all we have to do is leave the rest to the Milone Company. 'Good things come to those who wait,' after all. Just rest until you feel better."
"Ugh... it's so undignified,"
"I suppose you'll be off all day, then."
"Mm... it's pathetic, but you're right,"
"Did you have plans of some kind?"
"Hm? Well, I was thinking of doing some shopping after checking in with the Company."
"Shopping, is it? You can go on your own. I'll rest here awhile then return to the inn on my own,"
"Or what - did you want me to come along?"
"Oh, you're no fun,"
"I was thinking of buying you a comb or a hat,"
"Perhaps some other time."
"... Just what are you planning?"
"What a way to talk."
"As the saying goes, one has to be even more careful with meat in ones mouth than with meat that's about to be taken away."
"If you're going to act the prudent wisewolf, at least do something about your restless ears and tail."
"Oh!"
"That should make us even,"
"You've got such lovely hair, it seems a shame for you not to have a comb for it,"
"Oh, you're talking about my hair,"
"All you do is bind it back with a hempen string. You don't even comb it."
"My hair isn't important. A comb would be nice, though - for my tail."
"... Well, if you say so."
"So, then."
"Hm?"
"When will you buy this comb?"
"I thought you didn't need one,"
"I never said that. I would like a comb. A fine-tooth one, if possible."
"I'll buy you a brush. Shall I introduce you to a good weaver?"
"You... you would treat my tail as a simple piece of fur?"
"I cannot take this anymore,"
"What, are you going throw a tantrum now?"
"I can't take it. I have to vomit."
"Mmph... what's that sound?"
"How do you feel?"
"Better. A bit hungry, though."
"If your appetites back, you must be fine,"
"Is there anything to drink?"
"The water jug's right there."
"... A drawing of a shop?"
"My shop."
"Oh ho, not bad,"
"What's this writing?"
"Location and expense planning. I don't expect it to go exactly like this, of course."
"Hmm. You've drawn parts of a city, too, I see. What city is it?"
"None in particular - just an idealized city for my shop."
"Ho-ho. You've been very detailed here - I suppose you're planning to open it soon, then?"
"If the deal with the Milone Company goes well, I will probably be able to."
"Hm."
"It's every traveling merchant's dream to have a shop. I'm no different."
"Heh. I know. You've even gone so far as to sketch out your ideal city, so you must have done this many times before."
"When I draw it, I feel that it will happen someday."
"An artist I knew long ago said something like that - that he wanted to paint all the scenes he saw before him."
"I doubt the artist would have fulfilled his dream even now, but it seems that yours is getting closer."
"Indeed. When I think about it, I can hardly stay still - I want to run around the Milone Company, swatting the ass of every employee I see."
"I hope your dream comes true, then."
"Still, is having a shop such a good thing? Can't you do well as a traveling merchant?"
"If you profit, sure."
"What else would there be?"
"A traveling merchant might make the rounds between twenty or thirty towns - if you don't keep moving, you won't make any money at all. Most of your year is spent on a wagon."
"The life being what it is, you don't really make any friends - just business associates."
"But if I could open a shop, I'd become a true citizen of a town. I could make friends, and it would be simple to search for a wife. It would be a great solace to me to know where I would be buried when I die. Though finding a bride who'll stay beside me even in death... that will take some luck."
"searching for a wife,"
"It will be bad for me if you open a shop, though,"
"Why's that?"
"If you open a shop, you won't want to leave it. I'll have to either travel alone or find a different companion."
"You could travel alone, though, right?"
"I'm tired of being alone,"
"I expect I'll stay with you until you're back home in the north country, though."
"Really?"
"Even when the money comes in I won't be able to open up a store right away."
"Truly?"
"Why would I lie?"
"So come on, don't make that face,"
"Mm-hm,"
"Was it crying in your sleep that made your eyes red?"
"When I..."
"Hm?"
"When... when I open my eyes, they're gone. Yue, Inti, Paro, and Myuri... they're all gone. They're nowhere."
"I - I can live for centuries. So I thought I would go traveling. I was sure, so very sure, that I'd see them all again. But... they were gone. There was no one."
"I don't want to open my eyes and find no one there... I'm tired of being alone. It's cold. It's... lonely."
"... How humiliating,"
"Traveling merchants have dreams like that, too,"
"Your face is a mess. Hang on."
"But... this is your..."
"I always throw them away when I'm done. The deal isn't even fin- ished yet - it's too early to be optimistic,"
"I'm in your debt now,"
"I'm still sleepy. Can you sleep?"
"Soon, yes. Staying awake any longer would be a waste of candlelight. "Heh, spoken like a true merchant,"
"Wha- what are you-"
"Don't be such a prude,"
"... Can't breathe..."
"Have your eyes adjusted yet?"
"What do you-"
"I finally remembered what I was going to say to you."
"It's a bit late. There are three people outside the door. I doubt they are guests."
"We're on the second story. Fortunately there is no one outside. Are you ready?"
"Come, see my body 'neath the moonlight!"
"We'll have to run. We've no time to collect the horse."
"They will gain nothing by killing your horse; we'll wait for things to calm before retrieving it, yes?"
"Oh, also-"
"Just in case. You should take some, too,"
"Right, now let's run."
"So, what I was going to say to you was this - if the Milone Com- pany could check up on that boy, surely the reverse is true. His backers were bound to be alerted. If they discover we're gone to another com- pany with a deal, they'll try to silence us, no?"
"Milone Company"
"Oops. I don't know the way,"
"This way."
"Stop. There's a guard."
"Tch. We're so close."
"Heh-heh. I've not hunted in many years, but this is my first time being hunted."
"This is no time for jokes. Oh, well, we'll have to take the long way around. Lawrence backtracked to the original road, turning right along it. He decided that they'd take an alley after the next block and circle around to the Milone Company. But he was stopped after he made his first right turn. Holo grabbed his shirt and pushed him against the wall. "Did you find them? They should be close by! Find them!"
"Damn. There are too many of them. And they know the area."
"Mmm... 'tis a bad situation,"
"Shall we split up?"
"Not a bad idea, but I've a better one."
"Which is?"
"I'll head down the main road and draw them off. Then you can take the chance to-"
"Wait. You can't-"
"Now you listen. If we split up, you're the one that will be caught. On my own, I won't be caught, but you will. And when that happens, who is going to go to the company? Shall I show them my ears and tail and beg for your rescue? Well?"
"Either way it's no good. If the Milone Company sees your ears and tail, they may turn you over to the Church. And I needn't mention the Medio Company."
"So all I need do is avoid capture? And should I be caught, I'll just hide my ears and tail for a day while you come to rescue me."
"I'm Holo the Wisewolf. Even if my ears and tail are discovered, I'll pretend to be a mad wolf, and none will want to come near me."
"Your dream is to own a shop, is it not? And just a moment ago I said I was in your debt. Are you trying to make a dishonorable wolf of me?"
"Don't be foolish! If you're caught, you'll be killed! What honor is there in that? I'll wind up owing you a debt I can never repay!"
"Loneliness is a deadly illness. We are even."
"Besides, you're a quick thinker and clever - I promise. I trust you. I know you'll come for me."
"There they are! On Loinne Road!"
"Just one? There should be two!"
"There he is!"
"I'm Lawrence - I came earlier today! Help! I'm being pursued!"
"Wait, you! Give that man to us!"
"Scum!"
"Whose house do you think this is? It is the Milone Company's Pazzio branch, owned by the hon- orable Marquis Milone, recognized by His Grace, the thirty-third Archduke of Raondille! Anyone within these walls is a guest of the Marquis! Know that when you strike these gates, you strike His Grace's throne!"
"That's quite a commotion so late at night. What's going on here?"
"My humblest apologies, sir. I offer my deepest gratitude for your sanctuary."
"Save your thanks for the Grand Marquis of Milone. What did they want?"
"I expect they were from the Medio Company. Undoubtedly they are displeased with the deal I've struck with your company."
"Oh ho. You're a merchant who'll take risks. I haven't seen many of your kind lately."
"It's my partner that's the reckless one."
"Must be rough."
"I don't want to think about it, but that same partner may have been captured. Would it be possible for me to speak with the branch man- ager, Sir Marheit?"
"We're a foreign company. Raids and arson are a fact of life for us. He's already been contacted,"
"Anyway, come inside, will you? Even wine gets better with time,"
"In any case, if your partner's all right, he'll come here, eh? As long as you give us his name and description, we'll shelter him even if the Church itself comes after him!"
"My thanks. Surely... no, without question she'll come. Her name is Holo. She's a small girl, and wears a hood over her head."
"A girl, eh? Is she a beauty?"
"Of ten people, all of them would turn to look at her."
"Ha-ha-ha! That's something to look forward to, then,"
"Eight or nine out of ten of them will be Medio men."
"I agree. They have discovered that I came to you for assistance with my plan for the silver coin and are trying to stop us."
"I believe my companion may have been captured. If so, it seems ob- vious to me that negotiations will be impossible. Will the Milone lend its aid?"
"You say your companion may have been captured?"
"Yes."
"I see. After the commotion here, I sent some of my men to follow them. They reported seeing a girl taken, apparently against her will."
"That is probably my companion, Holo. She acted as a decoy so I could make it here."
"I see. But what would make them want to capture your partner?"
"I expect it's because we joined with your company in trying to thwart their plans."
"It's a bit strange, though, don't you think?"
"What's strange?!"
"Please calm yourself. Something is strange about all this."
"What's strange about it? Just as your company was able to easily check up on Zheren, it was simple for the Medio Company to see if anybody was interfering with their plan!"
"... True, given that their headquarters are here..."
"So what is strange?"
"Indeed, I understand now. This truly is strange,"
"I was thinking, how did they come to realize that you were conspiring with our company?"
"Surely because I came here frequently. Also, if they noticed that you'd started collecting trenni silver, all they'd have to do is put two and two together."
"That is the strange part. You're a traveling merchant, after all - vis- iting us several times to negotiate is entirely natural."
"But if they linked that to your company's interest in trenni silver and the fact that I'm the one Zheren contacted..."
"No, it's still strange."
"Why?"
"Naturally, the point at which we started gathering trenni silver was after we finished negotiating with you. Consider this, Mr. Lawrence: 'I cannot say how it will happen, but if you collect trenni silver your profit is guaranteed.' We certainly wouldn't do anything based on that alone, would we?"
"T-true..."
"The fact that we are indeed collecting trenni silver means we un- derstand the entirety of this opportunity. Undoubtedly the Medio Company also knows this. There's simply no reason to take you as hostages."
"Surely you don't mean-"
"I do. We already have all the information we need to turn a profit. What happens to you now is not our concern."
"I hope you will understand how difficult it is for me to say this. But we've already invested a significant amount of capital based on the in- formation you brought us. The profit will be immense. If we must choose between bearing your grudge or giving up the return, then..."
"I'm sorry, but I must choose the former,"
"Still..."
"demon-possessed"
"Please wait,"
"If your company has come to this conclusion, surely the other side has done so as well."
"Yes. That is what struck me as so strange. I hadn't finished speak- ing, you see - if the need arises, I will bear the grudge that you would harbor toward the company."
"still"
"I can see that your companion is very precious to you. But letting your emotions dull your thinking is misplacing your priorities."
"My apologies."
"Not at all - if my wife were in danger, I, too, would likely find it im- possible to calm myself,"
"wife."
"Back to the problem at hand, then. Our opponent is a canny com- pany that will not easily be thwarted. You and your partner have no theoretical value to them, yet they've targeted you - there must be a reason. Do you have any idea what it might be?"
"No, that can't be..."
"Have you thought of something?"
"The profit before us is almost unimaginable. We need only realize it. If you've thought of something, no matter how trivial, please tell me."
"demons"
"Mr. Lawrence,"
"Have you thought of something?"
"Excuse me,"
"What is it?"
"We just received a letter. It regards our current situation."
"'To the wolf... and the forest in which it resides?'"
"I'm sorry, but might I look at that letter first?"
"We have the wolf. The Church's doors are always open. If you don't want the wolf in your home, shut your doors and keep your family inside."
"My companion, Holo, is the wolf-god of the harvest,"
New Convo:

"There's no doubting the threat implied by this letter. They wish you, Mr. Lawrence, to know that if you don't want your partner given up to the Church you must stay inside and not interfere."
"They must want us to keep out of their way until their plan for the trenni silver is concluded, but that doesn't mean they won't still turn Holo in when they're through."
"Quite right. Furthermore, we've already invested quite heavily in the coin. Pulling out now means our losses would be huge because the trenni is guaranteed to depreciate."
"I suppose this means we have no choice but to strike first,"
"However, merely rescuing your companion won't be enough. Even if we hide her here, once the Church gets involved, we'll have no choice but to roll over and let them have their way. She can't hide as long as she's in this city."
"What if we flee the city entirely?"
"It's a great plain as far as the eye can see, and even if you reached another city, there's a chance you could be extradited. Then there'd be no hope for you at all."
"difficult"
"Is there nothing we can do?"
"At this rate, we won't even be able to avoid unfounded accusa- tions, to say nothing of actually making a profit."
"You're saying we need some kind of card we can play against them."
"You could put it that way. But even if we invest more capital, it's meager compared with what they stand to gain from trenni silver. So the problem can't be solved with money. We could report their abduc- tion of your companion to the Church, but that would cause problems for you, and you might even deliver an unfavorable testimony about our company."
"That... is quite possible."
"All I can think of,"
"is to finish negotiating the trenni silver deal and use the resulting profit as a trump card."
"The greatest gain that can be extracted from trenni silver is secur- ing special privileges from the king. According to our research, the fin- ances of the royal family are in decline. In other words, if this deal suc- ceeds, we'll have substantial favor with the royal family. Abandoning that..."
"Abandoning it for my companion makes no sense at all,"
"Are you suggesting that they purchase it from us?"
"If it comes down to a choice between destroying the Milone Com- pany or obtaining special privileges from the king, perhaps we could simply have them pay the equivalent value."
"If you will agree to the price we set and give us certain considerations, we will sell you the currency."
"Still... if they play their card, it won't just destroy this branch - we'll be burned at the stake. Will they deal with us?"
"Surely the king would be troubled to learn that the company with which he was dealing was to be burned as heretics."
"If we can sign a contract with the king, the Medio Company won't be able to touch us. Even if they try to turn us over to the Church, the king will not be pleased with the company that brought such trouble down upon him."
"I see. Still, they won't just stay silent. They might just try to bring us down with them."
"True."
"So in addition to the price for the privileges we'll hand over, we'll be demanding your companion."
"Yes."
"Hypothetically, it's a sound strategy. But I'm sure you realize it will be nearly impossible to execute."
"You're talking about how we'll surpass the Medio Company, yes?"
"As far as I can tell, the Medio Company has not yet collected a significant amount of silver."
"And your basis for saying so is...?"
"My basis is that they didn't immediately turn Holo over to the Church upon capturing her. If they already had enough silver, they would've gone directly to the Church in order to destroy us. Instead, they're trying to prevent us from moving, probably because they're concerned that in the time it would take for the Church to conclude our trial and sentencing, we would reach an agreement with the king. To put it another way, they think you've already collected enough sil- ver to begin negotiations. It shows they have no confidence in their own position."
"Also, I don't think the Medio Company wants anyone to know they are collecting trenni silver - this helps them take advantage of the kings weak position. From the standpoint of a nobleman dealing with the king, it shows consideration for the king's position and their rela- tionship in the future to say that he just happened to have a large amount of silver on hand, no matter how transparent the lie. But to have people like Zheren target traveling merchants and suck us into the deal, I think their aim is to begin by having merchants gather the silver for them, then buy it up at the opportune moment. Even if they suspect Zheren's motives, if someone's willing to buy the currency, they'll be happy to sell. This is all speculation on my part, but I don't think I'm wrong. If the Medio Company started buying trenni silver in bulk, every company in the area would notice the strange trend in the coin, and we'd be far from their only problem."
"Given all that, this may be possible,"
"All right, we'll assume the Medio Company is not prepared to move. Based on that assumption, what action do you suggest, Mr. Lawrence?"
"I will find Holo, rescue her, and we'll run until the negotiations are finished."
"You can't be serious."
"Escape may be impossible, but we'll buy you some time. Use it to gather as much silver as you can and conclude the negotiation."
"It's not possible."
"So you're going to turn Holo in, then? I'll be forced to publicly de- nounce the Milone Company."
"With the Milone Company's help, we should be able to escape for a day or two. She is a wolf spirit, after all. If she sets her strength to es- cape, none will be able to catch her."
"Mm... hm..."
"Holo was caught because she acted as a decoy. If we hadn't had a destination and sought only escape, that would've been easy. Might I ask how long your company will need to assemble sufficient coin to command the king's attention?"
"... How much time, you say?"
"If we send a rider to Trenni now, he'll make it there by sunset if all goes well. Assuming we can commence negotiation immediately, he'll return here by dawn tomorrow. Longer negotiation will lengthen his stay."
"Can you send a rider immediately? You haven't confirmed the amount of silver you have."
"There's a limit to how much coin we can house, so we can place a rough estimate on how much we'll be able to collect. As long as we have that much by the day of the actual transaction, we'll be fine."
"We wanted to negotiate only after we discovered who was backing the Medio Company, which would reveal their funding. Then we'd be able to both preempt their deal and estimate our own. But we've neither time to think nor to look for more information."
"Can you reach a fast settlement with the king?"
"If the Milone Company wills it, negotiations will be brief."
"I imagine you know where Holo is, then?"
"We are the Milone Company."
"Assassination of our employees and arson of our facilities are facts of daily life for us. That's why we make it a point to know the city better than anyone. We have contingencies for any emergency. Even if a le- gion of knights should storm the city walls, we'll survive. But we do have a rival."
"The Church?"
"Indeed. The Church, like us, has a far-reaching presence. Their front-line missionaries are especially like us in this regard, exceeding even our abilities. You're aware of this, no doubt."
"They are ubiquitous and elusive, yes."
"Should the Church launch a search in earnest, you must not run be- fore thinking - stay hidden in one place. Of course we hope to have the deal concluded by then. The password will be 'Pireon, numai.'"
"Two great gold coins, then?"
"It seemed auspicious. I shall pray for your success."
"I understand. Your hopes will be well met."
"Once I've descended, I should touch the right-hand wall and go for- ward, right?"
"Your destination is at the end. If all goes well, a hatch will open above you. Should you hear the word 'racche,' please wait for the es- cort to arrive. If you hear 'peroso,' though, make your escape with Holo along the planned route immediately."
"The good outcome and the bad, eh?"
"Easy to understand, isn't it?"
"We'll be there soon."
"I'm surprised they're so prepared,"
"Ah, here it is."
"S-surely not,"
"Racche,"
"Racche,"
"Numai!"
"Pireon,"
"Holo!"
"How am I to get down there if you don't make way?"
"What are you daydreaming about? Here, this is for you. Take it, and let's go."
"Wha- oh."
"Pireon,"
"Numai,"
"Looks like you made it safely,"
"Business is full of surprises,"
"There was another with us,"
"He'll be collecting the ladder and emerging elsewhere,"
"Once he's delivered the information about those Medio rascals to our friends, he'll leave the city."
"good luck to you"
"I'm so glad you're all right,"
"It's good that I'm all right, is it?"
"Say my name, then!"
"Uh... Holo?"
"Holo the Wisewolf!"
"I can remember every single person that's ever shamed me in my life. And now I must add another name to that list. Yours!"
"You told me, didn't you - you told me you'd come for me."
"And I... I utterly believed that you would come... grrh... just think- ing about it is infuriating!"
"You're a man, aren't you? You should've been in the front, fighting tooth and nail! But you were in that hole in the ground - you let me make a fool of myself-"
"But you're unhurt, right?"
"I'm glad you're all right,"
"So long as you carry that wheat with you, I'll not die."
"For a girl, there is a kind of suffering no easier than death."
"Heh. I'm so lovely that even human males fall for me. Not that a one of them is fit to be my mate,"
"If they tried to touch me, I'd just remind them that they might lose a limb, or worse - they'd pale at that, oh yes! Hee-hee-hee,"
"But there was an exception,"
"Who do you think was there among those who captured me?"
"Who was there?"
"It was Yarei. You remember him, no doubt."
"That-"
"That's it! The figure backing the Medio Company is Count Ehrendott!"
"As someone with huge tracts of wheat, he can request payment in whatever coin he wants! And if he could arrange favorable duties for his wheat, it would be like a gift from heaven to the Medio Company, the count, or even the villagers! Of course! And that explains why there was someone there who knew you were a wolf!"
"Did you hear what I just said?"
"I did indeed."
"The one backing the Medio Company is Count Ehrendott. The count and the merchants that deal with his wheat are the reason silver is being collected. Please inform Mr. Marheit."
"It shall be done,"
"... I do not follow you."
"Explaining it all could take some time. Let's just say that your in- formation was the key to figuring everything out."
"Huh."
"I'm sorry I interrupted you,"
"It's nothing."
"Yarei should still be locked away in the storehouse for the harvest festival. If he's in the city, that means he's involved in the deal. He's acquainted with the merchants that buy wheat from the village, and the village leader trusts him to do the dealing. Also, the bulk of the wheat sales are conducted immediately after the festival,"
"He must have heard my name from that boy Zheren. That Yarei was wearing clothes far too fine for any village and thought rather highly of himself."
"He must be deeply connected to the Medio Company. Did you talk to him?"
"Just a bit,"
"I don't know how many years I lived there. Maybe as many as there are hairs on my tail."
"I am Holo the Wisewolf. In order to provide the greatest harvest, there were years I had to let the land rest, so there were seasons of meager harvest, too. Still, the fields I lent my aid should've been more productive than others over time."
"The villagers did treat me as the god of the harvest - but not out of respect. It was akin to a desire to control me. Do they not chase after the person who cuts the last sheaf of wheat, after all? Do they not bind him with rope?"
"I've heard they lock the harvester away in the storehouse for a week with treats to eat and all the tools they'll use in the following year."
"The pork and duck were tasty, 'tis true."
"Still,"
"What do you think Yarei said to me?"
"He said he heard my name from Zheren, and it made him wonder. I... it is pathetic, but I was so happy to hear that..."
"Then he told me that the days when they had to worry about my mood were over. That they need no longer fear my fickle nature. That since the Church was already after me, they should just hand me over and be done with the old ways for good!"
"It doesn't really matter, in the end. I want to return to the north- land, so I must leave one way or another. If they have no love for me, I'll simply kick the dust from my hind legs and leave. 'Twill be a clean- er break that way. Still... I can't just leave it like this."
"I - no, we - are merchants. As long as we profit, we triumph. We laugh when money comes in, and cry only in bankruptcy. And we will laugh,"
"... I feel better."
"It's been centuries since I've had a proper conversation. My emo- tions are far too fragile. I've cried before you twice now, but I would have done it even if you had not been here. Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"You're telling me not to misunderstand."
"Mm-hm."
"I only brought you along to help me make money anyway. Until the Milone Company concludes its negotiations, our job is to escape. Hav- ing someone crying and carrying on in the middle of that is just a bur- den. So regardless of who was crying in front of me, I'd-"
"... That's not fair,"
"Mm-hm. Female privilege."
"We have arrived. Are you quite finished with your conversation?"
"We surely are,"
"It's true, then, that people who bring talk of profit are rather odd,"
"What, you mean my ears?"
"It makes me want to return to my traveling merchant days, looking at you two."
"I wouldn't if I were you,"
"You might end up running into someone like her."
"Ah, but a wagon bench is too wide for just one. I'd wish to be so lucky!"
"Surely I am the unfortunate one, to be picked up by the likes of you!"
"You're too clever by half."
"'Tis what makes me so charming,"
"Well... yes, you're quite charming,"
"... I'm so happy."
"You really are an adorable boy,"
"Too clever by half,"
New Convo:

"What is it?"
"Do you not feel a stirring in the air?"
"Isn't it coming from above?"
"No..."
"If I had whiskers I would be able to tell..."
"Are you sure it's not your imagination?"
"No... there's a sound. I can hear it. Water? The sound of splashes-"
"It's from ahead. This won't do. We must retreat."
"There are no forks in this path, yes?"
"The path we were taking was direct. Going the other way, there's one branch. Take that, and it becomes a complicated labyrinth."
"I don't know that even I could keep from getting lost here... whoops!"
"You, cover your ears."
"What? Why? " "Even if we run, they'll catch us. They've loosed the hounds on us."
"Heh. So foolish-sounding, that baying,"
"I'm not certain what I'll do if they're too stupid to understand this. Anyway, cover your ears!"
"Awooooooooooo!"
"Ugh... my throat..."
"An apple... I want an apple... koff-"
"You can have as many as you want once we're free. What of the hounds?"
"They turned tail and ran."
"Then we should do likewise. They'll know where we are now."
"Do you know the way?"
"More or less."
"Still, how did they find us?"
"I doubt they knew exactly where we were. They probably came un- derground after being unable to find us above and then happened to run into us."
"Ah."
"If they knew exactly where we were, they would've cornered us by now..."
"I see. You're quite right."
"The Milone Company has betrayed you! There's no point in runnin'!"
"Sounds like we've been sold out."
"And for a high price, no doubt. As long as you're here, the Milone Company will lose a branch, at the very least."
"... I see. That's a high price, indeed."
"Right, we turn right here."
"Wait-"
"There they are!"
"Do you know-"
"-the way? I do, it's all right,"
"Another dead end?"
"Damn. We'll have to head back. I don't remember anything else."
"Can you still run?"
"Just a bit,"
"Let's find a place to..."
"rest,"
"Ah, ah..."
"Ah-choo!"
"Rrrrrr."
"Wha- shit! Here! They're here!"
"O holy God, forgive me my sins..."
"Before you think about your sins,"
"regret your daily deeds!"
"Lawrence."
"Lawrence, are you all right?"
"What a relief. You weren't moving when I called to you."
"... Ugh. I'm okay. Just a little sleepy,"
"Pull yourself together! We're almost there."
"... We're almost where?"
"Did you not hear me? I said I can smell the warmth of the sun ahead. There must be a way to the surface close by."
"... This bandage?"
"I tore my sleeves off to patch you up. You didn't notice?"
"Uh, no, of course I noticed. I'm fine."
"Just a bit farther. We'll take this passage, then turn right..."
"Hurry, hurry,"
"It goes to the surface - just a little farther!"
"N-no..."
"Found them!"
"Back up."
"You cant - you're through!"
"Hardly. I can still move,"
"Fool, you don't need my ears to know that's a lie,"
"Ah-"
"I wondered, given the description we got,"
"But to think it really was you, Lawrence."
"I'm just as surprised,"
"Most of Pasloe thinks only of sickle or hoe at the mention of metal - to think they'd be involved in such a grand silver scheme."
"There are few who understand this transaction,"
"Let's catch up later, shall we? We've no time for it now."
"Come now, Yarei - I came all the way to your village and still wasn't able to see you."
"Ah, but you met someone else, didn't you?"
"I wouldn't have thought it possible, but she really is right out of the fairy tales. The wolf-spirit incarnate, responsible for harvests great and poor."
"Hand her over,"
"We'll give her to the Church and put the old ways to rest forever!"
"Lawrence, if we have her, we can destroy the Milone Company. Then once we've abolished the wheat tariff, the wheat of our village will be hugely prof- itable, and we who sell it rich men. Nothing is so profitable as an un- taxed commodity."
"Lawrence, our village still remembers that you bought wheat from us when we were suffering under heavy taxation. It would be no trouble to give you purchasing priority now. And we're friends, nay? Surely as a merchant you can figure gain and loss."
"Oh, I can figure gain and loss all right,"
"Ho, Lawrence!"
"However, a merchant must always honor his contracts,"
"Lawrence?"
"As fate would have it, this strange girl I've picked up wishes to return to the northlands. I have a contract to ac- company her there. Breaking that contract is something I cannot do, Yarei."
"You-"
"In that case, I have no choice but to fulfill my contract."
"I'm sorry our friendship was a short one, Lawrence."
"A traveling merchant is always saying good-bye,"
"You can kill the man. Bring the girl alive."
"H-Holo, what are you-"
"Holo... the dagger..."
"That's enough."
"Holo?"
"This may hurt a bit. Please bear it."
"What-"
"What are you doing! Hurry, take them!"
"Sh-she's drinking his blood!"
"Don't fall back! She's only a possessed girl! Get her!"
"I'll always..."
"I'll always remember that you chose me."
"Lawrence-"
"Please don't look at me."
"Aaaaauuggh!"
"god"
"Guh-"
"Wha-"
"None of you will leave here alive!"
"G-gods are always like that... always... unfair..."
"Holo, no!"
"Holo..."
"The wheat..."
"The wheat - bring it to me,"
"That is your answer. Now, the wheat-"
"I thank you for taking care of me,"
"W-wait!"
"Holo!"
"How... how much do you think the clothes you destroyed cost?"
"I don't care if you're a god or not... I'll see you pay me back! You earned but seventy silver pieces - that's not nearly enough!"
"How many years do you think it took me... to save up that much money? I'll follow you... I'll follow you all the way back to the north- lands, if I have to!"
"Ugh-"
"Ah, so you're awake, are you?"
"How are your injuries?"
"Better... thanks to you."
"I must apologize for putting you in such danger through our ineptitude."
"No, no, my companion was the cause of all this originally."
"Fortunately you were never discovered by the Church, and the dis- turbance happened underground. If the Church had seen your com- panion's true form, well... it's quite possible the entire company would've been burned as heretics."
"You saw her true form?"
"Indeed. The people we sent to rescue you returned with a report that there was a giant wolf that said it wouldn't hand you over until I came personally."
"What of Holo, then? Where is she?"
"She's gone on to the marketplace. She was quite impatient and said she needed traveling clothes,"
"You said Holo went to the marketplace. Does that mean negoti- ations with the Medio Company went well?"
"Yes. Our messenger returned from the Trenni castle this morning, concluding negotiations with the king. We've obtained the considera- tions that the Medio Company so desperately wanted, and they seem to have acknowledged their defeat. Everything has gone very smoothly,"
"I see. That's good to hear... So I've slept for a full day then, have I?"
"Hm? Oh, yes, yes you have. Would you care for some lunch? I was just in the kitchen, and I doubt they've turned off the stoves yet, so you could have something hot."
"No, that's quite all right. Could I perhaps hear the final results of our negotiation?"
"Yes, of course."
"The amount of silver we collected came to 307,212 pieces. The king plans to significantly cut the silver content of these coins, so he agreed to pay an amount equivalent to 350,000 pieces."
"According to our contract with you, Mr. Lawrence, we owe you five percent of our profit. Is that correct?"
"Please con- firm this,"
"Wha... what's..."
"One hundred and twenty pieces - five percent of our profit,"
"The cost of transporting the coins, the transfer fee when the king paid us, the silver tax, and the cost of processing the contract. His ad- visers undoubtedly put him up to it. They knew they would have to give up those special privileges but wanted to limit their losses on the silver exchange as much as they could."
"We calculate that our final profit was twenty-four hundred pieces, five percent of which we're remitting to you as per our agreement."
"This was not something we expected. The outcome is regrettable,"
"Unexpected outcomes are part and parcel of business,"
"It is generous of you to say so. However,"
"Unexpected situations can also work out happily. Here."
"The Medio Company badly wanted those special privileges, and they knew the silver they'd collected was going to depreciate rapidly soon, so it was like holding on to debt. They expected they'd be able to turn a profit with that tariff authority, and they would do anything to get it. They made us an offer almost immediately."
"A thousand pieces... is this really acceptable?"
"It is a trifle,"
"Also, we've taken care of the fees for your convalescence, and we'll handle the care of your horse and wagon."
"Was my horse unhurt?"
"Yes - it seems even the Medio Company didn't find much worth in him as a hostage."
"We'll discuss the payment details and so on another day, then, shall we?"
"That will be fine. Thank you so much, truly."
"Hardly; the pleasure is all ours. It is a small price to pay to remain in the good graces of a merchant of your ability, Mr. Lawrence."
"Oh, I suppose I should ask,"
"do you wish payment to be in silver? If you would prefer a different commodity, that can be arranged."
"Have you any pepper? It's light and compact, and as winter falls, its price will surely rise as meat becomes more available."
"Pepper, you say?"
"Is there a problem?"
"No, not at all. I recently read a play we received from the south, and that reminded me of it."
"A play?"
"Indeed. A demon appears before a wealthy merchant and says, 'Bring me the most delicious, succulent human you can, or I'll devour you.' Not wanting to die, the merchant presents the demon with the youngest, most beautiful maids in his house, and the plumpest foot- men. But the demon shakes his head in disapproval."
"I see."
"So the merchant scatters money throughout the city, searching for a suitable person. Finally he finds a handsome young monk who smells of milk and honey. He throws gold at the monastery to buy the lad and brings him before the demon. But the boy says, 'Oh ye demon who fights the gods, the most savory human in the land is not I.'"
"'The most succulent human is before your very eyes - he has car- ried spices day in and day out in his quest for money, and his fattened soul is perfectly seasoned,'"
"It's a religious play that the Church uses to preach moderation in commerce,"
"That's what I remembered. Pepper is surely appropriate for a merchant about to make his fortune, I think."
"I hope I soon have a body suffused with spices myself!"
"We'll look forward to that, and to many fruitful dealings in the fu- ture, Mr. Lawrence,"
"I'll see to your pepper. In the meantime, I have work to do..."
"Perhaps that's your companion,"
"Overseer, sir. We've received this bill-"
"This is definitely addressed to our company, but..."
"Mr. Lawrence, a bill's come for you."
"Could I see it, please?"
"Hmm..."
"Urn, excuse me-"
"Let me by!"
"Where's the loading dock?"
"Er, follow this hall to the end, turn left, and it'll be-"
"Thanks,"
"I wouldn't wish you to come to the northern forests simply to collect on a debt."
"I'll return home only after I've paid my debt."
"But of course!"
